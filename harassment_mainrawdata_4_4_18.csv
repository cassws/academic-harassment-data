3/8/2018 11:38:52,"I finished my PhD in November 2017. I for the first 3 years of it, I refused sustained and strenuous 'romantic advances' by two senior male members of staff in my department: one my PhD supervisor, and the other the Head of Department. The (I suppose) inevitable consequence was that I found myself excluded from teaching (despite previously great feedback), from giving research presentations and from the department social life. What was really shocking was the part played by their senior female colleague, then Head of Teaching and my supervisor’s wife's best friend, who became openly hostile towards me. It was so distressing and toxic that I became really depressed, and I went to the University's counselling service for advice, but they were no help at all. 

It actually got worse over the last two years of my programme, because my supervisor totally withdrew supervision - he put ridiculous conditions on meeting, ignored my emails, lied, gaslighted, belittled me and my work, and didn't read my thesis at all. I tried to get my second supervisor to take over, but she pulled away too, after speaking to Supervisor No. 1, and she didn't read my thesis in the months before submission either. I didn't take any formal action, for which I'll always kick myself. This was because the counselling service had been so useless, because I hoped that by keeping a low profile I'd limit the damage and stand a chance of getting references, and because my supervisor’s behaviour had become so unrestrained that I had begun to suspect he might be a psychopath. I'm so traumatised and angry. But the fact is that in that situation you have to focus every ounce of survival on getting the PhD.

3/3/2018 5:06:16,"A grad was in the final year of completing his dissertation. The professor who was the committee chair went abroad on sabbatical. The large timezone difference made it difficult to keep in touch other than via email. As a way to stay motivated without regular meetings with the chair, the grad turned to a writing support group. The group was mainly other grads, but there was one female assistant professor who hung around the grads. She seduced the grad into letting her ""help"" him publish one of his dissertation chapters, which she told him would be easy to do in a journal edited by a female friend of hers (who some years before had been an associate professor in the department). All she wanted in return was to be the co-author on the article. To be clear, she was not a member of his dissertation committee, had not been involved in the research at any stage, was not a Co-PI on any of the project funding, and was not even in the same discipline (it's a joint department). All she had done was some copy editing and write a new paragraph for the introduction to reorient the research to her field that, unsurprisingly, was entirely unsuited to the research design. The grad naively did as she told him and submitted the manuscript to the journal (with him as first author and her as second) and kept the submission from the committee chair. When he returned from sabbatical, someone else in the writing group told him what was going on. He told the grad that what he was doing with the assistant professor was completely unacceptable, inappropriate, and unethical, and that he must write the editor to withdraw the submission. The grad told the assistant professor and she put up major resistance and even refused to discuss the matter with the committee chair. She was supported by the female editor and another female associate professor in the department with a rumor campaign that the patriarchy was trying to abuse graduate students by poaching their research and that the committee chair was behaving unethically by refusing to allow her to “mentor” the grad. The grad student was distraught, and like many grads quite naive about the ethics of publishing, but after the committee chair pointed out that the assistant professor had not asked the grad to collaborate with her on coauthoring publications deriving from her dissertation, which she was then in the process of trying to publish, he began to see how he had been lured into an extremely unequal and exploitative relationship with a manipulative assistant professor. He remembered that it was the committee chair who had supported and guided his research for many years, intellectually and financially, apologized for his naivete, and began to get back on track with the plan to complete his dissertation. At the same time, he still had a relationship with the female assistant professor that he wanted to maintain. And the assistant professor was intransigent that it was her right to have relationships with grads she was not on the committee of, “mentor"" them, and coauthor articles derived from their dissertations. Just as the committee chair was going to report the situation to HR and others, including the journal publisher's legal department, three highly negative reviews came back. Even the conspiring editor could not cover up that degree of rejection. Apparently, wonder of wonders, the reviewers thought the data were excellent but required a completely different analytical approach to become acceptable for publication in their field. With the adulterated manuscript rejected by the reviewers, the female editor used that turn of events as an excuse to withdraw her participation in the plan to poach the grad's research and escape possible repercussions from the journal publisher’s legal department. With an easy publication no longer in sight, the female assistant professor dropped the grad like a hot potato. The committee chair did not file official complaints with HR or the journal publisher. He wanted to in order to protect other grads from being similarly exploited in future, but ultimately he realized that his primary responsibility was to his current student, who had apologized profusely for his naive behavior. Filing complaints could create future difficulties for the student just as he was starting out on his career. Out of the same fears, the grad also did not file a complaint with HR. So, in the end, the grad did what he should have done in the first place -- he worked with his committee chair to finalize analysis of the data, finished writing the dissertation, graduated, published dissertation chapters in journals, and got a tenure-track position.",male grad and male full professor,"female assistant professor, female associate professor, and female editor",Other R1,Louisiana State U,,,,"None of the women involved have had any impact on their careers so far, have never apologized, and have never wanted to talk about it. The lack of apology or even willingness to discuss it and give their side of the story indicates that either they have learned nothing and remain intransigent deplorables or that they now realize that they acted in a highly inappropriate manner and are embarrassed by it. Regarding her tenure case, the assistant professor will be better off with one fewer article than with an unethical one when she comes up. The editor has suffered some damage to her reputation. The associate professor who advised the assistant professor to act in such a deplorable manner continues to focus more on expressing her indignity at the patriarchy than on publishing enough to apply for promotion.","Nothing for either the grad or the committee chair except for a nasty rumor mill, which can be a useful weapon of the weak but, in this case, is a weapon of the deplorables.","It caused a great deal of stress for the grad but does not seem to have had any persistent impacts, since his career and romantic life ultimately worked out wonderfully, with a position as an assistant professor and marriage.

We met at a bar, and when it started to empty, he suggested we go to the rooftop of his apartment complex, where many of my friends lived.

I repeated that I was leaving, and without saying anything, he picked me up, carried me into his bedroom, and pinned me to the bed.

2/18/2018 17:17:22,"Prior to the MPSA conference in 2010, a male prof said to me in casual conversation, ""You're going to Midwest? We should get together for a drink."" I said, ""Sounds great. But, [my husband] and I have family in Chicago, so my schedule will be packed between conference and family obligations. Let's catch up at the reception for the black (poc) political scientists [name has changed since].""
I didn't hear from him until the conference reception. He wasn't at the reception, so as a courtesy, I sent an email from my phone: ""Sorry I missed you at the reception, maybe another time."" I was looking for a way to get out of getting together because my husband wanted to spend time with his family and did not want to join. I didn't want to have a drink with this person alone but was concerned about offending a colleague likely to get tenure before me.
NOTE: This was my second semester at this institution. The male prof had been hired temporarily by then-chair and his friend at the time, [full prof and chair], who was working to get this male prof a TT position. It seemed clear to me (and the rest of the dept) that he would be tenured before me. 
He responded to my email indicating he was at [I can't remember the name of the hotel restaurant] and requested I join him for a drink. He included his cell to call or text. I sent a text message with the same basic response as my email. He seemed to insist.
I texted or called [can't remember] my husband because I really did not want to be alone with this person. I asked my husband what I should do. My husband said, ""I'm having a good time with my uncle. It seems like you have to or should go for a drink, but I don't want to.""
I met the male prof at the restaurant. In the lobby, I ran into a former student who was in grad school or at a post-doc at the time [can't remember which]. I tried to get the grad student (or anyone else) to join us, but he had other plans.
Over the course of the conversation, the male prof put his hand on my knee and said, ""I'm sensing a mutual attraction."" I said, ""That's a nice compliment, but I'm happily married.""
NOTE: I did not want to offend someone who would likely be voting on my tenure. Also, you never know how men will respond to rejection. I have experienced some very hostile responses by men to even the kindest rejection. I was also thinking that this is a simple misunderstanding and (hopefully) not a big deal. If I seem like it's no big deal, maybe he'll not hold it against me... 
He responded, ""You can't just come up to my room, fuck and forget it?""
At that point, I quickly signed the check and walked quickly out the door and down the street. Ambar chased after me and said, ""I'm sorry. Now I feel like I did something wrong.""
I wanted to smooth it over and not make any enemies. I said, ""No, it's fine, just a misunderstanding. I've got to get back to my husband. It's no big deal.""
Then, I got immediately into a cab and left.
Afterwards, I spoke about the incident with my husband (that evening) and my dad later (by phone). I was concerned that I had miscommunicated and that I shouldn't have put myself in that situation. They were both clear that a woman should be able to meet with a colleague and not have that experience.
I also spoke about this with a senior female colleague inside my department, a female colleague at my same rank, a senior female colleague in other department, and a staff member. The advice was overwhelmingly that there is nothing I can do that will not put my tenure at risk.

I am also aware of some undergraduate students who might have been harassed later by the same male professor.
My husband, and I usually try to have students over for dinner once a semester. Generally, this is for graduate students, but some of my classes are graduate/undergraduate, and we decided it's not fair to only invite some students.
In 2013 (pretty sure it was the spring semester), we had students over for dinner at the end of the semester. We overheard a few of them talking in a side conversation about explicit comments from a professor to a couple of female undergraduates. A male undergraduate was telling the young women, ""that's wrong"" and ""he can't do that."" The male undergraduate was encouraging them to report it. We did not hear the details, but we interjected. I said, ""I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but from the little bit that I heard, that is NOT ok. It shouldn't happen to you, and it is NOT your fault."" I also told them that there is not much that I can do as an untenured professor but encouraged them to talk with a female full professor that they trust. They did not want to report it, and I do not believe that they reported it at the time. The only details that I know from those students is that there were ""sexually explicit"" and ""inappropriate"" comments made to at least two female students in class and some inappropriate fb messages to at least one by the same male professor who had harassed me.

I feel incredibly guilty about the fact that I did not report the incident that happened to me or what I learned from students in this case. We (faculty and staff) were not trained as mandatory reporters until 2015 or 2016 at my institution. I also feel terrible because I do not think that this has stopped.
 
I should also mention that this male professor voted against me for tenure. My tenure case received unanimous support from the college tenure committee, the Dean, and the Provost's Office because I had a strong case.
Initially, I was afraid to talk about this even after tenure because I believed that people might think that I'm just bitter and trying to get revenge. After speaking with several other colleagues, I've realized that actually it's evidence of retribution.

I'm submitting this information to you because as a tenured faculty member I have a duty to protect young people from this kind of abuse. I wish that I had done something sooner. I may be out of a job if I had done so, but that does not alleviate the guilt I feel about the fact that I did not report and others were affected by that decision.

He left abruptly halfway through our meeting and a glass of wine and said he be right back (he had forgot something).  He returned with marijuana and asked if we could go smoke. I willingly invited him to my place where of course, he made a move on me.  Long story short, I ended up pregnant.  I decided to keep the baby because of personal morals.  The day I finally told him I was pregnant--10 weeks along--all he said was, ""fuck, I am going to get a divorce.""  This was news to me: that I was sexually harassed and impregnated by a married professor with children. He never asked me to get an abortion either, maybe I would have if I had the financial support?  Throughout the pregnancy, he went totally absent and would only reach out here and there for comfort with how to deal with his wife (added to my distress).  I was so depressed that I did not have the power to say or do anything during and after the pregnancy.  After the baby came, he would come over to my house uninvited and/or with about 10 minutes warning as he had to ""sneak around to see the baby.""  He was trying really hard at this point to be a ""good husband.""  When the baby was about 8-months old I was given information that the professor, without the truth-teller knowing about my situation, had a history of ""coercing students"" (undergraduates, graduates, all of the above) into their homes with marijuana and fucking them.  This was the moment I took my power back.  His response to me addressing him with this knowledge: telling his wife.  They both then decided to collectively harass me for the next 5-months, whereby they would not support me financially and were so crude to me--reminding me always how I ruined their lives, yet wanting to see my daughter.  I was so desperate for help--am nowhere near family--because of needing to pass my qualifying exams that I let them watch the baby on the weekends.  I eventually tried to put my foot down and ask for financial support ($20/week) and then the professor said that my daughter meant nothing to him and that we should never talk to them again because we did nothing but cause distress for their family--my child was not their family.  I of course gladly agreed that that was a great idea--to not communicate anymore and to leave them alone.  I didn't speak to them, vice versa, for about 5-months when the new academic school year began and the professor stalked me and my child on campus (I had to attend an after-hours event and as a single-mom had no choice but to bring baby) where the professor picked the baby up in front of shared colleagues, calling her child, etc.  I immediately and finally went to TIX the next day.

Once the report was sent out, retaliation eventually followed suit by way of my department chair (who also has a history of predating on female students--has a child with and eventually married one after divorcing his wife) and eventually the case went to the federal level (it is still under investigation).

When I showed up for work, visibly pregnant, she looked me up and down slowly and scowled, and began to ""talk around me"", not to me. When I met with her that week to discuss work goals, she told me I was ""stupid and crazy"" for being pregnant as a post-doc, and that she ""wouldn't have hired me if she had known that I was pregnant"". She suggested that I should have aborted once I got the job with her, so I could focus on my career. Hilariously, she recounted tales of how she SCUBA-dived when she was a pregnant post-doc, basically saying that she could accomplish research when she was pregnant, but that I wouldn't be capable at doing so. She also gave me unwanted advice, such as getting a C-section was preferable so that I wouldn't wreck myself ""down there"". She gave me this particular advice several times, including on the day I gave birth. She purposefully put up roadblocks to my research (switching goals capriciously), and made it difficult for me to work on my project, and then tried to pin my difficulties on me. I had filed a complaint with HR after that first meeting, because I could sense that she was trying to find ways to fire me.

2/4/2018 20:20:41,"In 1969 as a 17 year old beginning Music student at University of Queensland I was targeted for grooming and sexual abuse in the organ loft of St John’s Cathedral. I began complaining in 1997, to the university, the police, and the church where the organ loft was situated. Four complaints to the police have been rejected. In 2014, my lawyer was successful in organizing a mediation with the church and I received a modest settlement. But the late Professor Freda Briggs warned me I would have more trouble with the University of Queensland, and this has proven to be the case. It is now a year since, in the glare of the Australian Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse (I was a child of 17 at the time of the abuse), the University finally agreed to investigate. But they are dragging their heels. In 2002 an article appeared in the media following comments former Archbishop Hollingworth made in relation to my case. The article was seen by the son of a 12 year old victim of the same man, who died after disclosing her abuse to her son. His vocation as a priest, marriage, and health, have been destroyed by the Church because he made a respectful approach to tell his mother’s story. In addition, he is the nephew of the former Chancellor of the University, with whom he is furious for the cover up of his mother’s case. His mother’s abuse occurred in the 1950s. My abuser was appointed a Lecturer in Organ in the 60s. Despite my constant complaints, and the severity of the abuse, I am not hopeful of a resolution. My story is on the website SNAPAustralia. My abuser has been decorated by the Queen with an OBE, the Archbishop of Canterbury with the title Cantuar, and has an honorary doctorate in Music conferred by the University of Queensland. I have nothing and do not fear a defamation suit. My abuser is named on the SNAPAustralia website in ‘Sylvia’s Story’. I will not rest until he is brought to justice, although the abuse occurred so long ago. It has ruined my life, made it impossible for me to have the career in music that I practised so many hours to achieve, and led to an unwise and turbulent marriage. I can’t understand why he is still being protected. I have several documents supporting my story and would be happy to share them.

However, he is still in the same post, and nothing was made public. I gather from mutual friends that his behaviour is widely known in the institution, but because of lack of formal action, it's often dismissed as gossip and rumours.","It was a source of stress in deciding whether to apply for a job in the institution he taught in, knowing that we would still be working in close proximity.

I understand why people don't want to report harassment (and not much happened when I did), because if you're in a fixed-term job you don't want to be a trouble-maker, and in a small field you may have to work with the person and his friends later.

I brought up the incident with my chair and he appointed me, together with two other colleagues (both of them my seniors, one male and one female), to deal with this. we had meetings with grad students, discussions, meetings. another female grad. student came to me confidentially to complain about another male senior faculty member dating graduate students.  i made a big stink about it in the department and as a result i was identified as a bully, a McCarthy-like figure, and someone to avoid.

1/28/2018 6:29:39,"Prof X and I had a working relationship which I thought was just like the working relationship he had with other MA and PhD students. I knew that he tended to have favourites - mostly men - and I just thought that I was one of them. He would invite groups of us to his house for dinner, and we would all go to the pub together after classes. It was an intellectually stimulating and friendly environment. The fact that there were a number of others that he showed similar levels of attention to made me assume that he was just treating me in the same way. I was friendly and informal with him, and I trusted him, I even talked to him about the impact that family troubles had had on me personally.

After one of the dinners, he sent me a text message saying 'you are so beautiful, what is a boy to do?' At this point I had started a relationship with one of the PhD students in the group, which he and everybody in the group knew about. We had had a lot to drink that evening, and so I just ignored the message. I thought of it as a strange but ultimately innocent comment that one of my father's friends might say after too many whiskies (Prof X is older than my father).  

After that the comments became more frequent. It was confusing because at this point I had known him for several years, I had worked for him, I had had coffee with him to discuss work, and I had been to many many gathering where there were lots of MA and PhD students who were all very relaxed and chatty with the faculty members. This meant that I didn't see how inappropriate some of the things he was saying were. It quickly escalated to the point where in the pub at the end of term, just before several deadlines, and I was about to start my dissertation, he grabbed my arm and confessed feelings for me in front of my partner (the PhD student), and a couple of others at the table. I pulled my arm out of his grip and said something along the lines of 'that's very nice but I don't see you in that way', and left with my partner. I thought that that would be the end of it. The next day he posted a package through my letter box containing earrings, a card, and a cd 'mixtape' he'd made for me. I was gobsmacked. I was already shocked by what had happened the night before, but thought I had made it clear that I wasn't interested in him in that way. 

I had arranged to go away for the holiday break that day, and left without saying anything to anybody about it. After a few days Prof X sent me a message asking if I'd received the present and if I liked it. I said 'they're nice but I'm very shocked', he replied 'What! Shocked! I thought I'd made my feelings clear! You give the most seductive looks', I replied that 'I'd never seen him as anything other than a teacher, mentor and friend'. The next day he sent an apologic message, and asked if he could come to see me to talk things though, I said 'no' and that I didn't want any contact from him. Eventually we met, and I told him I wasn't going to report it, he seemed happy about that. Following this he continued to make inappropriate comments at times, and to put cards in my inbox, but it happens much less frequently now that I am married, and I avoid him as much as possible.  

He refused to help me with my PhD application, and prior to the main incident, when I still went to him for advice about academic things he was actively discouraging me from following up opportunities with other faculty members (I discuss this more below).

It was a very strange situation, and initially I felt sorry for him, and that it was my fault, I had, after all, been friendly with him for years, and I ignored the initial messages, but now I see that his actions were calculated and wildly inappropriate given the age difference, and the academic power imbalance, and I am, frankly, furious. ","MA student. I was about to start writing my dissertation, and was considering doing a PhD.","Professor. He had been one of my lecturers for several years, while I was an undergraduate and an MA student.

But I am going to complete, and I hope that I can use the experience to motivate me to do well, and to create a safer academic environment for women.","I have had multiple mental health break downs since the peak of the harrassment. I was depressed for a year immediately after, while in Italy, and then after I returned. I had a mental health crisis during my first pregnancy (2 years ago). The harrassment by Prof X was not the only thing fuelling that crisis, but it was among the events that had impacted on my sense of self-worth as an adult, and triggered old feelings of helplessness and worthlessness. ","Immeasurable. It profoundly undermined my, already fragile, intellectual self-esteem. All of the MA students I knew who successfully gained PhD funding did so with the support of a lecturer/mentor who helped with the application, and guided them with regards to where  and how to apply etc. Prof X was my main academic contact. I had had a couple of other academics tell me that they would be interested in supervising me if I wanted to do a PhD. I asked Prof X for his views on doing a PhD with those people, and he discouraged me. He told me I should apply for another institution in Italy, where, coincidentally, he had a arranged to spend a semester as a visiting scholar.

After the event, I was so upset and my intellectual self-confidence was so low that I ran away from academia. I felt betrayed, and did not trust any of the other academics in my field in that department (all men at the time). I didn't want to work with another man, because I felt that I couldn't trust any of them, and that any positive comments or encouragement I had received from them was due to them wanting something sexual, rather than because they thought I was good.

I decided to spend a year in Italy teaching English while I figured out what to do next, which did nothing to help my academic CV. Towards the end of the year in Italy I decided that I still wanted to do a PhD, and that I shouldn't let what happened set me back any further. I contacted the only person I felt I could for advice - Prof X, he became hostile when I asked him if he had any advice about how to go about applying for PhD funding, saying that I was taking advantage of his 'soft spot' for me.     

I ended up starting a PhD with a woman in a different department. What I didn't realise, and what would have helped to know, was that because my 2 degrees were from another department, my CV wasn't looked upon particularly favourably in that department, so I didn't get any funding. People from my original department (that of Prof X) told me that some money had come up, and my name had been mentioned as a strong candidate - but I was immediately dismissed because at that stage I was enrolled in a different department. 

So this meant that I started a PhD with somebody who I got on well with and trusted on a personal level, but wasn't a good academic match for me, without any funding. After it became clear to me that we were not a good match, I transferred over to my original department under the supervision of one of the people who had told me I should do a PhD while I was an MA student.

I am now a self-funded part-time PhD student. I have a project, and will complete, but I cannot quantify how much what happened has set me back work, and mental health, wise. I ran away, I enrolled in the wrong department, missing funding opportunities because I just didn't undertand how funding works, and the person I asked (Prof X) implied that it was inapproriate to ask for help, I still have crippling self-doubt and feel like I shouldn't be there. This is magnified by the fact that I am self-funded, and the students with funding seem to get looked on more favourably by faculty members. I am hoping to complete soon, but being self-funded it has taken a lot longer to get the work done. ",,Man,43128270595,no,Other,Political Theory,Political,"MA student.

She usually wears extra large/baggy t-shirts, but when at department events/conferences she tries to dress more professionally. We were attending a multi-department function with 50+ people. My friend was wearing a women's suit with a shirt underneath. A tiny bit of her cleavage was showing (less than an inch-which is amazing given her size). She was really self conscious about it and I assured her that she looked great and that things would be fine. We walked into the event and the chair of my department immediately approached her.  He said in public ""That's a really low-cut shirt you have there. We don't usually see you in something that is so suggestive to men."" He smiled as he said it. She turned red, smiled and froze. The chair chuckled, turned and walked away. My friend was so upset by the comment that she quickly turned and left. I left with her. She had to meet with the chair a few weeks later and he made another comment after seeing her enter his office in a baggy t-shirt. ""I thought you would wear that professional low-cut number you wore the other night."" She proceeded to make suggestive comments for the next few weeks every time he saw her. I watched as she changed her hours for being on campus to avoid him, missed department functions etc. Given the climate at Michigan State University and how professors, administrators, athletics is protected she didn't want to say anything, but as I watched her get further and further depressed, self conscious etc. I knew I had to do something.

Nothing happened to the chair. Nothing. He remained the chair until his contract was up. He is still a professor in the department. The professor I reported it to experienced retaliation. I felt horrible about this. The next semester I lost all of my funding from the department. Completely confused by this, I contacted the chair and was told ""sometimes other people out perform you."" When I showed him my record having more publications than any other student, more awards etc. and asked how I could drop from #1 to below #30 in less than a semester, he refused to answer and only said ""our decision process is confidential.""

I always had permission to be in the class from the professors and the VA doesn't care what classes I take, so long as this is an accreditted college. So because the admin person was sexually harassing me, I was also forced to endure mistreatment based on my protective status as a veteran. After everything was filled out, this sexual harasser would then insist on sitting down and reviewing my entire career at the school, claiming he could not read his writing. When I complained to the head of the VA, he insisted angrily that the sexual harasser worked in the finance office. That he does but he also represented the Veterans at the school. The head of the VA department for CCBC did not care that I was being sexually harassed or that I was forced to wait 2 hours at the Veterans desk at the finance office. He wasn't listening and was instead angry that I refused to go to his frat party where alcohol was served. He then insisted that I was mentally ill for using the adult words, ""CYA"" and ""BS."" What I meant was that these people refused to allow me to leave their office until they had covered their butts that the class was paid for and that I would not sue CCBC if I took an elective for fun that I wanted, seeing as I already have a degree and the classes I took with them were just for fun. And it is totally BS that they would force me to stand there and wait in their office for hours while they track down professors who have a life. I said nothing wrong but this abusive faculty member told me I was insane and that he was calling the behavioral health department to punish me for speaking  up to him about the sexual abuse, harassment I had received at CCBC. I had already told him that I had quit the campus a week before. Needless to say the abusive woman at the behavioral health department called me on my cell despite the fact that she had in writing that I was no longer a studdent, and she left a voicemail telling me she would recommend me mental  health treatments. I called her back and asked her to quit stalking me since she knew I was not a student and she had no legal right to call me and because I had done nothing wrong. In this was she was psychologically abusing me and defending piss poor treatment, sexual harrassment, age discrimination, Veteran's discrimination I had recieved, and MANY MANY other students have placed on ratemyprofessor.com, or had told me in person they had suffered. I watched the staff demean and speak down to other students, I watched 2 of my proffessors scream and yell at students and stomp out of the clasroom.Students talked about fights they had with students and named names in front of other students, and students whisper to each other about the staff behind their backs, and sometimes in front of other students. One professsor admitted she hated her careerfield as a child, and hated teaching in public schools. Many of the professors bragged about only getting their degree so they could make money teaching at the college level. I put up with the chronic sexual abuse, psychological abuse, verbal abuse, gang stalking, age discrination and disccrimination against veterans and the over all violent, explosive and hostile environment until I could take no more.

Our class then went on a trip to Costa Rica over the summer, where things got more intense.  He drank with the students frequently, and at one of our stops we had two cabins rented: one for men and one for women, and he insisted on staying in the women's cabin, ""for protection"".  He spent that time walking around in his underwear and drinking.  A few times when we were taking group pictures, he would put his hand on my butt and squeeze, but there was no way to tell him to stop without making a scene in front of everyone, including other professors. I felt that he was more or less acting in creepy ways, and had discussed this with other students, but two of us had gotten food poisoning and while we were sick he made a point to take care of us. Then, both of us felt really guilty about labeling him a creep, and both decided to give him another chance. At another location, he asked me to come with him to get some food and wine from his cabin to bring back for the rest of the class, and while we were getting it, he started rubbing my shoulders, and I made an excuse to go. Then, on our last night there, myself and several other students were talking with him, the other professors, and the owner of the farm where we were staying.  It was getting late, and people were starting to go to bed.  We had all been drinking.  I said goodnight and started walking through the woods to my cabin.  A few minutes into my walk (in the dark, in the woods) I heard someone calling my name and he caught up to me.  He told me that he had a lot of connections and that he helped a lot of his students get really far in good biology careers. He mentioned jobs that some of his former grad students had.  He told me that he saw a lot of potential in me, and then he kissed me.  When I turned away from his kiss, he held me tight so I couldn't walk away and said ""let's try that again"" and kissed me on the mouth, with tongue. I said that I was tired and needed to go to bed, so he asked me if he could at least hug me, I said yes.  Then he holds me tight and rubs his erection against my body for a few moments, as a struggle to get away. Then he let go of me and insisted on holding my hand and walking me back to my cabin.
When we returned home, I mentioned this to some of the other girls on the trip with me and several female students had similar stories of being touched in ways that could have possibly been an accident, or him trying to rub their shoulders or kiss them.

We were put into small groups to make it easier to interact and work on whatever assignments we had. A man sat beside me and we had to introduce ourselves and write down a question to find out more about them. This individual wrote down that he just wanted to be with me. I laughed it off because I thought I would never see this guy again. Sadly, he became a physical and virtual stalker to the point that he was following me places. I used to like to work late at the university (the grad building) and he had overheard me telling someone I was going to be there late. I drove by the place at 11pm and he was standing outside the door (you needed a pass to get in). I kept driving. He stalked me to the point where I was scared for my safety. He would send me numerous message (several an hour late at night --- and I stopped responding to them). He also met with my supervisor to find out more about me. My supervisor didn't know at the time that this guy had begun to be obsessive, so naively he gave him information about me (he was under the impression that I knew this stalker and that we were friends). The stalker would send me messages saying that my supervisor wanted me to meet with him (among other things) and when I stopped responding, his emails got more and more threatening and hostile. I told my supervisor who agreed that there was something wrong, so he met with the guy. The guy continued to put things (notes, presents, etc.) in my department mailbox, email me and stalk me. I finally went to the police and they gave me tips on how to stay safe (never walk alone, let others know where you are, don't reply to the guy, etc.) and told me to wipe my online profile, so I did.

This professor had been my undergraduate advisor and mentor (and chair of my undergrad thesis). The first instance occurred during my first semester as a graduate student at a different university. Two female friends of mine (who were still students at the University where the professor taught) and I were hanging out with the professor and a few other (male) professors and former students of his from different institutions at the hotel bar. He was buying my friends and I drinks and had clearly had a few himself before we showed up. Pretty soon the other people we were with left for the night and it was just my two friends and I with the professor drinking and catching up. Pretty soon the conversation turned sexual, with the advances very pointedly directed at me. There was no touching (this time), but the comments were very sexual, and he even insinuated that I should go up to his room with him instead of with my two friends who I was rooming with. It was completely unexpected since this professor never made any remotely sexual passes at me while I was his student. None of us knew how to react except to laugh it off. The next day he approached me and apologized ""if"" he had been inappropriate the night before and blamed it on the alcohol. The last night of the conference we ended up outside the hotel smoking with a group of maybe 10-15 professors and grad students from various universities. He was very drunk again and came up to drunkenly apologize again, but insisted that he hold my hand while doing so. After this conference I began to doubt myself and question if the A's I earned in his classes, the letters of recommendation he wrote, and the research opportunities I had with him were only given to me because he had sexual/romantic feelings for me and not because of my merit as a scholar. Two years later at the same conference I confronted him about the incident (I had seen him a few times since, but it had been kind of awkward and I tried to keep my distance). We had both been drinking, but him especially. He told me that he ""loved me in many ways"" but that he would never give me recommendations or opportunities I didn't deserve based on my abilities. I believed him and I felt that we had reached some sort of resolution with the whole thing. Then, a bit later that night he went to two female friends I had been with during the first incident and propositioned them to come up to his room with him to keep him company. That sense of resolution immediately went out the window. After the conference he contacted me to apologize. I insisted that he also reach out to my two friends and apologize to them, which he did. I haven't seen him much since, and I think things will always be a little awkward between us.

1/13/2018 10:31:23,"In 2011, I was tasked with observing an adjunct's class in order to evaluate her teaching. I got there a couple minutes late and slipped in the back, taking a seat amongst the students. Because of my late and discrete arrival, most of the students were unaware a professor was sitting amongst them. During the lecture, I found myself distracted by the laptop screen of a student in the next row and one seat up. He was perusing a website of nothing but photos of scantily clad female models in bathing suits, lingerie, and less. At the break, I asked for his name, told him I was a professor, told him that what he was doing was inappropriate, and demanded that he knock it off. He did. After the class, I informed the professor, then my department chair, who encouraged me to follow up with other administrative offices. The three of us agreed that this was inappropriate classroom behavior. However, convincing other University officials of that proved impossible. I spoke with an administrator in the Dean of Students office who accused me of ""getting emotional"" and refused to take the issue seriously. He agreed to speak with the student, but I actually asked him not to. I realized that having someone who didn't think this was an issue and who couldn't refrain from undermining me would only make the situation worse. I also spoke with the head of our Title IX/EEOC office, who incidentally moved on to George Washington University and, according to the Washington Post, is now getting sued for not addressing a harassment complaint. That guy said there was no policy that prevented the student from doing what he was doing. He also was solely concerned about the University's liability, not amending the student's behavior, not on fixing University policy, and not the effect on the other students in the class. As in, he literally didn't care about the actual hostile environment created by the student's porn browsing habit, just that I had reported it as required! (The class was overwhelmingly male. How are female students supposed to feel comfortable participating in class if they have to watch their male peers look at porn?) I ended up dropping the whole thing in disgust. I later learned that other, more enlightened universities actually use this example in seminars about how to identify sexual harassment.

1/12/2018 20:02:12,"My MSc advisor verbally abused and sexually harassed me, sometimes in front of undergraduates in the lab. My lack of smiling displeased him so he would take me outside and walk me around the campus, berating me (probably so no one in the dept could hear him), telling me I was a nothing and a nobody and by letting me in his lab he was doing me a huge service and I should treat him better since it was a privilege for me to be there. After the move to the new place where I didn't know anyone and was being berated, I went to a psychiatrist and was prescribed some medication. It made me sleep all the time and my progress slowed. I finally decided I should talk to my advisor because of this to let him know what was going on. I didn't tell him he was part of the problem. However, he was not sympathetic, made fun of me, and I left his office in tears. I was blamed for anything that ever went wrong in the lab, even if it wasn't my fault.

1/12/2018 19:41:04,"1. Undergrad: I took many grad seminars, and one male grad student briefly stalked me during and after class, and made me feel very uncomfortable. Another male grad student picked up on what was happening and did the best he could to block the stalker when possible. I discussed this with my then boyfriend (now spouse), and remained vigilant. The incident was brief, and ended once the semester was over. 

2. Grad: Upon entering grad school, I was surprised by how sexism is rampant.
There was an odd expectation that because we were peers at a prestigious institution, I would welcome the attention of these men. They asked no questions about whether or not I was in a relationship (I was, and am now happily married). They just projected their desires onto me, making sure that nothing was sexually overt enough for me to report or complain about. The sad and pathetic thing is that if these men treated me like a human being, these incidents would have just been a matter of one individual expressing interest in another individual. Of course, they would have been rejected. 
   a) I met a prospective cohort member at a visiting weekend for potential candidates. He seemed oddly interested in the fact that I was younger than him. Later, when he found out that we were both going to the same program (different school from the visit), he sent me an unsolicited email about how he can show me around town, because he had lived there before as a visiting student. He tried to find every reason to talk to me, and even went as far as to pretend that I ""dropped"" my books in the library, by taking them out of my tote bag when I wasn't looking. I kept on ignoring him when he would try to catch my attention. 
   b) I had one classmate pretend to be a gentleman by letting me go ahead through a doorway to the stairs. The staircase is wide enough for two people to climb at once, and was empty, but he stayed behind me the whole time, staring at my calves. I was wearing a long-sleeve sweater, knee-length skirt and low-heeled pumps. We went three flights of stairs like this. Later, he sent me an unsolicited and very poorly written email about a random event at the local library screening a documentary. I didn't respond. Later, he tried to make me talk to him by charging his books to my carrel - it was by pure coincidence that I intercepted the delivery before it was made.
  c) An advanced grad student whom I had never met before, called me by my name in our department lobby and introduced himself to me. It was only after that I realized that I had never once said my name - so how did he know who I was and how I looked? Afterwards he tried to keep saying hello to me, and I would ignore him. 
  d) When I did my fieldwork abroad, I had lunch with my faculty sponsor and was introduced to an advisee. I found it odd that student would only talk to me when the professor left to pay for the lunch or use the restroom, but thought that perhaps he was being very polite (not uncommon given the local culture). After lunch he asked me where I lived. An email he sent to me indicated that he had no idea what my research topic was, and he offered me his years-long research on what he assumed was data that I wanted and needed. I politely informed him of my research in my reply, and he did not email me back. We've to interact at conferences, but since he found out about my engagement and eventual marriage, he has stopped talking to me unless it is out of pure necessity. 
     
There have been many other instances of male grad students staring at me, trying to touch me or touching me without consent, and generally treating me like fresh meat, rather than a colleague. These male grad students are worse than undergraduate men.  

3. I'm glad that I've only had two instances where a professor or someone senior in my field has harassed me. 
a. A visiting professor kept suggesting that I modify my research trajectory, making references to his past relationship to someone who was in my field. When I was getting food at a reception he said: ""Well you don't have to worry about what you eat.... (looking at me up and down)....because you're fit."" 

b. The worst thing that has happened to me, which pales in comparison to the horrors that others have experienced, was perpetrated by a retired curator from a foreign country. As I was carrying a tray full of tea through a short corridor, he put his arm around my waist and his hand on my hip. It was brief - 20 seconds at most. I was an intern in the presence of many important people, and could not do anything bar dropping the tray and making a scene. The incident disturbed and upset me.

These experiences made me change my lifestyle. I stopped wearing skirts and dresses, except for when my spouse would visit me on weekends from his institution. I stopped studying on campus and stayed holed up in my tiny studio apartment, even though the department gave each of us amazing carrels in a beautiful library. I avoided staying too long at department functions, and declined invitations to parties organized by my cohort members. I cut off my long hair before embarking on year long fieldwork, because I knew that this would minimize unwanted attention from men while I was alone in a country that is ""civilized"" and  ""polite"" but quite sexist. I think very carefully about how to dress for certain events, in anticipation of unwanted attention. I know that being an East Asian woman has a lot to do with how these perpetrators treated me, and how people continue to perceive me.

1/12/2018 19:23:14,"In a literature class, an older male professor asked women during class whether they’d ever been sexually harassed in academia. Most of us were uncomfortable and unsure how to answer. He kept asking the question, insisting that he did not think sexual harassment occured at our university. Some of us finally answered that we had witnessed, heard about, or experienced sexual harassment on campus (professors making comments about women’s bodies and appearances, unwanted touching, etc.), but kept it general because of the classroom setting we were in. One of my colleagues in class had experienced harassment, making this conversation very awkward and personal. All of the men were staring at the women with disbelief, waiting for us to share personal details of trauma. After we shared vague and anonymous accounta, the professor looked incredulous and proceeded to question whether our experiences had really occurred. I think he was genuinely in disbelief, but somehow didn’t realize that he was contributing to the problem. This professor also routinely made comments in class about undergraduate students’ bodies and clothing. 

Another “celebrity” literature professor told students in class that women tend to be smart or pretty, and rarely both.

1/12/2018 18:31:34,"My major professor made a ""pass"" by asking to kiss me within a couple of weeks of arriving at the program. I was told by other grad students that sexual predation was very common by the male faculty and that often students were willing. I was not willing, and the professor did not push the matter, nor punish me for refusing his advance. However, he made the same advance on his next grad student and they entered a relationship that led to inequitable treatment of his other advisees (who were obliviousness as to the relationship). He then proceeded to sleep with a series of subsequent students. This experience and the overall hostility toward women that I experienced at this university in the early 1990s were not unique. One female faculty member told me that the chemistry department had barred one of their pregnant colleagues from faculty meetings when her pregnancy began to show. There were other stories that circulated about how female faculty members were treated inequitably in the promotion and tenure process, particularly if their research addressed gender. I don't know the truth of these narratives, but they contributed to a culture of gender marginalization.

 The universities I've been at since have frowned on faculty sleeping with students - which is a significant improvement. At my current university, faculty have been fired for inappropriate sexual conduct. However, I've seen female faculty sexually harassed by male faculty; never with consequences. I've seen strong female leaders marginalized. I've experienced having my work attributed to others and having my work erased while men doing the same task are recognized and rewarded.

Male faculty assaulting, intoxicating, and impregnating (I am not exaggerating, this has happened twice in five years) female graduate students, and, sadly, undergraduates. Ending contracts of female contingent faculty (who are too senior to be contingent in the first place) for refusing the advances of senior leadership. Multiple faculty targeting vulnerable women. As far as I know, not a single woman graduate student has made it through her first two years in the program without being victimized. Because so many department leaders, including the chair, have been serially harassing so many female graduate students, contingent faculty, and junior faculty for so long, to expose them would be to expose the university at large. As such, university leadership is colluding with a weak Title IX office and complicit HR officials to retaliate against anyone who speaks up, and to allow punished faculty back on the job after ""rehabilitation"" when they are a clear threat. Senior faculty members who are in a position to do something about the problem fear this retaliation and are rewarded with inflated salaries and random small grants and sweetened work assignments for minimizing the problem by not reporting or discouraging victims from reporting. Some are in denial; others cynically play along.

I did not want to dance 'closely' with him, but I didn't want to sour the mood, be seen as up tight, or threaten potential future research opportunities, so I agreed under duress. The moment he got close to me, he started aggressively groping my whole body with both hands and his own body, holding me in a vice-like grip. Meanwhile, his co-researcher leapt up from behind and said, 'hey, where's mine?' and stuck his tongue into my ear and licked vigorously down my neck.

He sabotaged me in various ways and gave me lukewarm performance reviews. It was so bad that I asked the Provost if I could leave the tenure track and go on contract instead. She said no. While the tenure process was initially going well, one day he invited my committee to a meeting. A big supporter who was on my committee said she left that meeting feeling somehow convinced that I was undeserving. Although she shook that off and continued to be of great support, I suspect that I lost the support of the others;  eventually I was denied tenure. There were other factors and I don't claim to be perfect, but I believe that under the previous department head I would have been tenured.
This was in December. As the academic year progressed Prof. X's behavior became more and more bizarre. He began to miss classes and disappear for days at a time. The following summer I was told confidentially (there was of course a non-disclosure agreement) that he had been forced to resign. It turned out that he had been defrocked by his church for inappropriate ""counseling"" sessions and the administration became aware that the same sort of behavior had occurred on campus. It was later discovered that he had left his previous job, along with his leadership position in a different religious denomination, under similar circumstances.",Assistant Professor,"Department Head, Tenured",Small Liberal Arts College,,Religion,,,"He was eventually forced to resign from this school but went on to another school in another state, another religious denomination, and another and another after that.

Throughout grad school and in previous jobs I had a reputation for being gritty and overcoming obstacles, for being daring and willing to challenge the status quo, but after this I felt defeated and unable to push forward anymore.
There were various other things that happened at the school that contributed to this. It was a sick and dysfunctional environment and others were harmed by things that occurred there, before, during, and after my time there.  
I've long thought that the reason for his actions was that I was a threat to him in that I had observed and suspected a bit of what he was up to and might expose it. Thinking back after writing this, it occurs to me that this man, for all his trysting, must have disrespected and despised women. (The one woman from whom I later heard said that the ""affair"" consisted of a regularly scheduled, weekly glass of wine and a blow job.) He must have hated that I was a strong woman who could not be manipulated by him, and was immune to the charisma and charm that had worked so well on most everyone else, so he became determined to destroy me. Sadly, he more or less did. I will have to reflect on this and see if I can use this insight positively. ","The timing coincided with the beginning of the recession and jobs were scare.

This ended up being a pretense for trying to have sex with me, though, and after I rejected him, this colleague later went on to spread vicious rumors about me and attempted to thwart and ruin my career. 

The details: this senior ""rockstar"" contacted me about serving on a panel with him at an upcoming national conference, then proceeded to send me lewd text messages (including photos of his genitalia) in the months leading up to the conference. I explained several times that I was married, that I wasn't interested, but I was relying on this conference panel to boost my sphere of contacts and so tried to take a lighthearted and laughing approach to his advances. This involved continuously steering the text message and email conversations back towards more professional topics. 

He told me to arrive a day early to the conference because a big dinner was planned and he would be able to introduce me to some influential people. I did as he instructed, but there was no big dinner: it was reservation for two, and included only me and him. During the dinner, he told me that he had an erection and he pressed himself against me under the table. He was convinced that we would wind up having sex with each other, which he told me point blank. I made excuses, laughed it off, and exited the dinner as quickly as possible, trying to save face.

I can also make sure that you never get to spend time in the same room as them."")

I later learned from a close friend / colleague (one of this man's former graduate advisees) that he had told everyone that we had had sex the night before, but that afterwords I had gotten ""crazy"" and ""weird,"" which was why he felt the need to avoid me.

Our advisor had this student organize our field work, so I had to share a hotel room with him despite feeling unsafe doing so. There was also a time period when the student became obsessed with guns. Then one day he announced he'd gotten a gun permit and would soon have a gun. I stopped going in to the lab because that terrified me. The lab group's research scientists were also scared, so one of them decided to talk to campus mental health services about our fears for this student having a gun.

I wasn't able to provide witnesses to the professor's comment - my friends who were with me didn't hear it and the people who did hear it were the professor's fiancee/wife at the time (she was one of his current or former grad students), and a few other grad students who were buddy-buddy with him.

He also started to talk about me maybe working for his research center and that I should think about continuing past the master's. 

I ignored what now seem like deliberate attempts for him to get closer to me personally because I knew he had a girlfriend, who was a former student he mentored who still worked for the department. His relationship, and that he started this just a day or two after his class with her ended (and that he had also singled her out in class, like me), was public knowledge for other professors and some students. However, after he broke up with her he began to find awkward ways to point out that he was now single, and he became more aggressive in trying to find out about and discuss my non-academic interests. Discussions about me writing an article with his help, working for him, and and maybe even pursuing the PhD became more serious.

I eventually spoke to the professor in the most non-confrontational manner I could. I told him that I was excited about working on projects with him, but made it clear that I try to draw lines between work / school and my personal life. His reaction was very calm, including a few lines about just trying to be friendly. However, in the coming days he gave tepid responses to e-mails about my research or possibly working for his research center, citing his schedule and other issues. He also lacked his previous excitement when he saw me and would try to leave the area quickly.

For the grad class, he required one-on-one meetings to discuss our papers, and would often shut the door during the meetings. He asked nearly every woman-identified student to meet with him at a bar to ""discuss the paper"" and suggest he was asking ONLY that person because they were ""special."" For the students that met with him, he didn't discuss the course or paper at all, and would ask really personal questions, including about their ""love life."" He rarely returned graded papers and graded based on how he felt about a student. In one instance he lowered a student's grade after she confronted him.

When I worked for him I could tell he was trying to groom me. He would rarely discuss work and try to tell me how ""special"" I was. He frequently made sexist comments about students and faculty, including saying that women were too ""maternal"" to be good professors, ""especially in our department.""

I freaked out but didn't know if it was ok to try to leave or what. Nothing like this had ever happened the previous 2 years I've known her. Her husband had just left the room and I couldn't process what was happening. She rubbed all over me and wrapped herself around me and pulled my arms around her and got so close to my face I thought she was going to kiss me but I kept pulling back and moving my head. I don't know how long this lasted. It seemed like an eternity and I was in a total panic. I remember backing up and backing up until I hit a little table behind me. She tried and tried to get me to participate but I was so stiff and freaked out. She got mad and threw my hand down and complained. The whole time I just couldn't process what was happening. It was surreal and part of me wanted to engage because I was worried that she was upset. I had soooo much respect for her. I admired her so much and felt like I was disrespecting her by upsetting her but I was also scared. She ended up lying on the couch reaching out for me. She brought her knees up and was reaching for me asking what came next before bed as she thumped her knee into my side over and over spreading her legs. I still have trouble fully processing it all and have nightmares about it. I pulled her up and she got angry. She pushed me aside and walked out of the room. I followed her and then she acted like nothing happened. I was so confused. Then she reached out and hugged me and I just let her. She held me for a very long time and I felt so bad but I have a lot of childhood trauma that she knows about and things like that just make things worse for me. She let go and then I just stared at her trying to understand why all this was happening, trying to read her, if she was drunk or drugged or just self-absorbed. She pulled me in again and hugged me for a long time again. It was more confusing so I pulled away and tried to joke about it all and ran off. I wondered where the hell her husband was and why he never came back from his room! Was this a planned situation? I can't help but think the way things unfolded that it's not unusual and she said it later that she did this with others. I called a friend that night on my way home and told her. She was blown away but I just joked and tried to play if off. The next day I was really triggered and couldn't stop talking about my childhood trauma and also how bad I felt for feeling aroused by my chair's behavior with me. I was still very confused. I told another friend and she was very angry. I attempted to process it with my chair but she instead threatened that I shouldn't tell anyone especially not my campus therapist or she would get in big trouble. I still didn't understand the magnitude of this and I couldn't process it all. We finally met after several weeks of back and forth and she blamed me for everything. She said it was my fault that I came over and that she knew I had feelings for her and so I should've told her at the start and that would've never happened. She said I should've had better boundaries and that I couldn't blame her for my past issues. I didn't know what to say. I just kept saying that what I felt about her wasn't what she was claiming. We went round and round then she said I hoped I felt better now that we cleared it up and we should only meet to work on my dissertation and she scheduled a date. I was numb. I felt a pit in my stomach like something was very wrong and it was only going to get worse. She asked me what I was feeling now that we had talked things out and I told her I felt anxiety. We walked to the parking lot to her car and she asked me if she could have a hug. I just started to cry. She gave me a hug and I walked off knowing I had to do something else to never have to see her again. The problem is we share a ton of circles in and outside of the university. I left feeling afraid and more confused and not sure who to confide in. I ended up telling my therapist and he urged me to report it to the university. I also changed chairs but not without some trouble with the department. I didn't say why which was part of the trouble but I was finally able to do it. By then I was feeling angry instead of afraid and confused and I wrote her a long email explaining how she made me feel and how upset I was with her. She responded with how it wasn't her intent and that I had mis-characterized her. It was still about her and not what she did to me. I blocked her and asked her to delete any shared online spaces with me which she has. In that email I also told her I wasn't going to lie to people if we showed up to shared spaces and they asked why we weren't speaking. Since then, she hasn't shown up to 3 shared events which makes me feel like maybe she does finally realize she was wrong with what she did to me. Still I am angry that I constantly have flashbacks and find myself thinking about what happened and still trying to make peace with it. She gets to continue her privileged life while I continue struggling with the emotional distress of either keeping this to myself or speaking out- either way it's still an undue burden for me to carry with no real resolution in sight.

Across the department, he was overly familiar with students -- at least one other student in the program spoke to the department head about how his extreme and unwanted interest in her work/research/goals -- and before/after classes, in the library, and over Facebook and email, he divulged extensive personal information about his ongoing divorce, mental health issues, and perceived mistreatment by full -time faculty and the department.

I was a young woman at the time, and we planned a multi-day out of state excursion for the donors that involved a lot of dinners with booze, cocktail hours & nightcaps, and hotels. There was one donor with a reputation for being handsy. My boss told me as much--that the donor had physically cornered and groped the center's other female staff assistant. My boss told me that if the same thing happened to me, I should just brush off the donor and let my boss know--but not to antagonize the donor, and definitely not to alert the police, because we needed the guy's money. WTF! Basically I felt like I was being used as bait--the pretty, vivacious young woman who was there to cater to their every whim and make them feel important. Fortunately, the donor never got near me. I just kept my head on a swivel at all times and ran in the other direction when I saw him stumbling drunkenly towards me. But on that trip, I was also put in another difficult situation in which I feel that my youth and gender were exploited. I was asked to drive a dean home from a party back to his hotel. Thankfully he didn't hit on me, but he was stumbling drunk and insisted on continuing to drink (ie, have an open container) in my car.

The assistant director of housing began sexually harassing other females and myself. He was not our direct supervisor, though he was above us in rank. The harassment would vary from comments - comments made to me included that we should be married, as we acted like an old married couple - to unwanted touching. At one point, he would randomly hug us. My coworker was making copies, and he came up from behind her and wrapped his arms around her. 

My coworkers and I approached the associate director, our direct supervisor, who then approached the director of housing and our regional manager, each of whom were male. While the associate director advocated for strict action in the situation, the director and regional manager just told him to stay away from us. 

Unfortunately, the associate director took a position at another university in town, and after he left, we were forced to report directly to the assistant director. My peer, the one who had been hugged at the copy machine, also left, which left myself and our student employees.

When I said I wanted to leave, he said he couldn't drive and then told me I could lie down. I went into the bedroom without him and shut the door to try to think of how to get out of this house. He entered and grabbed me, saying ""I love you like a daughter, like a lover...I don't know what."" I reiterated I wanted to leave. I felt extreme pressure, since at the time my thesis grade was still out and this man was solely responsible for that grade. Finally, he took me home--after I said I was leaving. (My plan was just to run, until I was far enough and could call someone.) I was supposed to meet some friends two hours before I arrived home--they were worried about me. The next day he gave me a present--a ""graduation gift"" and told me in writing he was ""Sorry...just sorry."" When I didn't respond, he resent the card, changing the message to say ""Sorry...just sorry parting is such sweet sorrow (Romeo and Juliet)).",Senior in college,Senior Thesis Adviser,Small Liberal Arts College,Colorado College,I still feel it's too small of school to say this.,,"A sexual assault counselor spoke with me, after one of my roommates reported me for an eating disorder. (I didn't have one, I just was so upset and nervous after that night that I kept puking whenever I ate or someone mentioned the professor. I totally thought this event was my fault.) The counselor was very helpful and I met with her several times, but the way CC worked was you could not submit a formal complaint or expect any punitive action anonymously. If you wanted to complain you had to go in front of a board of nine professors and tell your story. In a school of less than 2,000 students, I felt this would ruin my chances of ever getting a recommendation again and would ruin my standing at the school. (As confidentiality, didn't seem to be a part of this process.) CC helped me when I couldn't go to my last class, which was a requirement for graduating, because I was too stressed/sick from the event. I asked repeatedly for this professor to not be at graduation events. The school finally agreed to my request after I said I didn't feel safe. Eventually, the chair of my department helped me enroll in an independent study so I could graduate on time. They had me speak to several lawyers--who asked me more questions about what I was wearing and how much I drank--than about him.","None. As of a year or two ago, he still taught there and was celebrated. If he doesn't work there anymore it's because he retired. ","I stopped entirely.

","For about three months I had horrible vomiting sessions of any thought or mention of this man. To this day, I have almost no friends from college, because I freaked out so bad at the end of my time at CC. I loved that college so much, and yet, I have never gone to homecoming or any event because I am afraid to go on the campus. I am afraid I will see him. I went last year (2016--nine years later) after being convinced to go, and I just wanted to leave. I was terrified. 

On another note, I spent a lot of time feeling guilt because I wasn't raped. And I felt I had ""asked for it."" It seemed very obvious to other people that he was using me. ","I never want to be alone with male bosses, coworkers, etc. I am overly cautious about seeming flirtatious or overly friendly.

Probably, the most devastating aspect was I don't perform or do that type of art anymore. I loved it. I lived to perform my entire life and then because of one night and one person, I couldn't get over it.

1/11/2018 14:50:19,"My colleague and roommate frequently made conversations sexual and found excuses to touch me. He admitted to having been sympathetic to red pill attitudes, having abused his girlfriend, and having wanted to physically attack a previous female roommate after a fight over laundry. I lived with him and one other roommate. Two nights after my third roommate moved out, we went to a dinner at some friends. When we returned he expressed interest in me. I turned him down but he proceeded to argue with me for two hours about my reasons for turning him down. I did think it was strange that the time he'd choose to make his interest known was when there was no one else in the department and I was drunk, but I chalked it up to bad decision-making. Two weeks later we were at a bar and he kept buying my shots because I was celebrating an academic success with our colleagues. When we got home he again propositioned me again and argued with me for more than an hour instead of accepting my answer. He also physically blocked me from leaving my seat during this until I begged to go to the bathroom. Once I got away I barricaded myself in my room, since my door didn't have a lock. Several nights later I awoke to seeing him standing outside of my door looking in at me. I confessed what happened to a female colleague and she told me he had hit on her when she first got to campus. I heard a similar story from a third female colleague. 

I felt these incidents were likely to continue and escalate and sought recourse from the faculty to prevent that from happening. I also thought I had an obligation as an employee of the institution to report sexual harassment, but apparently there is a loophole where you can decline to report sexual harassment directed towards yourself. I was unaware of this. A female colleague was supposed to replace me in the house and she was good friends with him, so I didn't think she would listen if I tried to warn her. I thought the best way to protect her, other female colleagues, and the undergraduates that he supervised as a teaching assistant was to report the situation to the Dean of my department. I was unaware I could have gone directly to Title IX without going to the faculty as an intermediary. ",Graduate student,Graduate student,Other Research Agency,Northern Illinois University,Philosophy,,"I told a female professor, who guided me to the Dean. They both guided me through a title IX process. As mandated reporters, they reported my complaints, which were enough that the Title IX office decided to launch an investigation. However, even though I limited who I spoke to (a female colleague and a friend unaffiliated with the department), my harasser spoke to many (perhaps all) of the faculty and grad students in order to disseminate his side of the story. After I complained about this, we were both told to stop talking to anyone about the case. As a result, these people only heard his side of the story, whose details were vague, downplayed, or entirely different from mine. I dropped classes because while I could handle my cohort hating me, I couldn't handle being in a class with a professor who thought of me as an hysteric. I lost all contact with all of my professors except for my thesis advisor. I heard a rumor that all faculty was encouraged not to communicate with me at all unless absolutely necessary, in order to be neutral and protect the department. That rumor would explain my experience. I had applied to PhD programs and some of them were calling faculty connections to inquire about me. I did very well in my acceptance rate, but I do know at least one faculty member thought I was overreacting and putting the faculty in a bad position. Apparently he was angry that I did not take advantage of the loophole that I wasn't obliged to report harassment if it happened to me-- a loophole I was unaware of. I will never know is his opinion impacted my acceptances.",None. I chose to request that the investigation not be pursued because the faculty had become completely distant to me and I heard rumors that my actions were not well-received by faculty members.,I still worry about the opinion of faculty members at NIU impacting my career. I don't know if it affected my acceptance to PhD programs. ,"My fervent wish is that I had never gone to the faculty with my problem. I had to move out and pay two rents anyways. I was encouraged to do so by my Dean. Interestingly, he made no such recommendations to my roommate. He described our living in the same apartment as analogous to a divorced couple living together. What I experienced after reporting the incidents was much, much worse than the incident itself.

I was surprised at how badly it effected me. I have had over ten men try to rape me, so what this student did was nothing. I went forward to 1) prevent him from doing something that would really screw me up, 2) protect the women in the department, particularly the student who was supposed to replace me (and I was successful in that), and 3) satisfy my obligations as an employee of the school. I was prepared for my colleagues to turn against me. I wasn't prepared for the faculty to be completely unsupportive. I wasn't prepared for them to think the incident wasn't a big deal. Because of my history, I always think I am too accepting of egregious behavior, and I did have to be convinced by my female colleague that what he had done was problematic. 

I think I felt betrayed. The faculty talked so well about the women in philosophy problem. The male faculty members seemed really invested in it. However, their distance, and the rumors I heard about their views of me, made me realize it's all talk. I understand the incentives at play. If my harasser experienced consequences that became public, that would hurt the reputation of the department, and there have been several cases that have ruined departmental reputations even when the departments took the right steps. I suspect that my department talks about this issue very strongly in order to prevent it from happening, but when it actually does happen, they are going to protect the department and not try to protect the victim or remedy the behavior of the harasser. 

The thing is, I can deal with a sexist environment. I've worked in incredibly sexist environments, and I've done well. A faculty that presents itself as protective of its female students, but which will not back up that messaging should a student need it, is much more dangerous than an overtly sexist department. If I had been in an overtly sexist department, I simply wouldn't have reported, moved out, and my life would have gone much better. 

I experienced a three-month long, intense depressive episode. I couldn't get out of bed. I literally peed in a cup several times because I couldn't be bothered to go to the bathroom. I was barely able to get together the money and paperwork together to move on to my PhD program. I am worried this student will get into my PhD program so I have been unable to really commit to this program, because I know if he's accepted here, I will probably leave. He's very manipulative and he already ruined my reputation once. He will do it here too and I don't feel I can explain the situation to my current department because they might think of me as hysterical and prone to overreaction, just as my previous faculty did. I am still depressed. I alternate between too much sleep and insomnia. I self-medicate with alcohol frequently. I am unable to do the work I need to be doing in my PhD program.","I will never report sexual harassment again. Never. My biggest fear in becoming an academic is having a female student come to me with a sexual harassment problem, because I know that female faculty members have lost their jobs trying to stand up for their students. I know the female professor I turned to was pressured into behaving differently than she wanted to.

1/11/2018 14:04:08,"Example 1: I was repeatedly sexually harassed while in the coursework portion of my PhD program by a student in a previous year.  He had repeatedly told me he thought I was awful but then began making comments like he would have sex with me to shut me up or I'm much more attractive when my mouth is shut or I'd be more attractive with something in my mouth.  He made sexual gestures once standing in the back of the room while I was presenting a paper in a class.

Example 2: I was in my second year in the same program.  A student contacted me after we exchanged numbers while working on a class project.  He wanted to get a workout buddy.  I was game at first but wanted to make sure he was aware I had a boyfriend and would not date other people in the program under any circumstances.  He assured me he was gay and we were just friends.  We hung out a couple of times and then he turned really touchy-feely.  I made it known I did not like that.  He apologized but then called me again and again begging me to hang out. I did not want to so I texted him back and said I was not interested because I found him too involved in my personal life and needed to just keep things professional.  He responded by threatening to kill himself if I would not see him and pleaded with me to leave my boyfriend.  After I blocked his number and reported it, he insisted on sitting next to me in class, trying to have sidebar conversations with me, and stole my notes while I was writing.

When I discussed this with my then-advisor, she recommended I ignore most of it because some of it was said during department functions off campus and I would be fobbed off or blamed.

2: I reported it to the DGS and called campus PD to do a wellness check (he was in his office).  My DGS took it seriously but the chair poo-pooed it and blamed me.  The professor of our class said me bringing my personal business into his classroom was inappropriate and unprofessional and then reduced my participation grade for the distraction.  I wanted to appeal it but my advisor was concerned it could hurt my chances of passing comps among other faculty since the chair had already decided I was a ""problem"".","1: He still works as an adjunct faculty member at a private research university.

2: He failed out of our program for unrelated reasons.  He went to another program for a master's degree which took him 4 years to get.  He harassed other female students there, too.  I heard from faculty in that program that he was frequently unstable in classes and female faculty were made uncomfortable by him.","1: Anytime I had to be in class with him again, it was a distraction.  Other students knew about it and just thought of it as ""drama"" so it was distracting all around.

1/11/2018 13:50:02,"- the most serious incident involved a fellow PhD student in my department, Political Science, at York University in Toronto. We had been friends, strictly platonic, not even flirting, since I started the program (three years by then). One night we ran into each other at a free outdoor concert. I had drank one large beer prior. We went back to his apartment with some friends of mine and his brother and his brother's friends. At his apartment he made me a drink. I don't remember anything after that. I woke up the next day, terrified and unable to even move my body. I felt extremely ill. I didn't know own where I was. I was in a strange bedroom. There was no one else there. I was also naked and covered with scrapes and bruises.  It took hours of laying there terrified before I felt well enough to try and get up and find my clothes. Eventually he came into the bedroom and my heart sank as I realized where I was. I was shocked. I would have never ever consented to sex with him. I identified as a lesbian at the time. Openly. He knew I was a lesbian. We had never flirted. He had a girlfriend who was a friend of mine. I asked him what happened. He said that I came on to him. I told him I was ""in love"" with him. Then he said that he had sex with me. He said the scrapes were from me falling down because I couldn't walk straight and then a few minutes later said, ""but I didn't think you were that drunk""... He also said that I tried to run out of the apartment naked and he chased me. He laughed as if it was a funny thing for me to do. He said I told him that ""men always tell women what to do!""  I have absolutely no memory of it myself. I have to trust him version. But I don't. An expert told me that it sounded like I had been drugged. Even if I wasn't, if I was so drunk that I was falling down and badly scraping my body (if that is where the scrapes came from) how could he not realize that I was too drunk to consent. If I passed out, which I must have, why did he just leave me alone in his room all morning and not check on me or call an ambulance? I was so humiliated and scared that I wasn't thinking right. I made him promise not to tell anyone. I went home as fast as I could. I told myself never to think of it ever again. I tried to burry it. But I couldn't. I started to hate academia. He became more and more successful and I became depressed and withdrawn. 

I have seen other male PhD students in my department go after young undergrad women, often when they are drunk at campus bars, in predatory ways. I've heard rumours of tenured professors doing the same thing to female grad students. Every grad student party I went to I felt uncomfortable at. Men would touch your arm or lower back without asking, they barely knew me. They would flirt.

1/11/2018 13:44:01,"I have heard so many stories, so will just report my own. I will only report three main ones. 1) In 2002 I was a brand new graduate student doing fieldwork in a remote location. I was warned in advance that the PI had a ""reputation"" so I was wary. After about a week we were all sitting around a campfire. I had avoided him, but he seemed to find me. He sat down and started talking. I admit to being abrupt with him, but didn't want to be rude so started talking more. He seemed just conversational but then asked about my body, which took me off guard. He laughed and said he just wanted to know what sports I had done in high school to shape my body for life. After telling him I had been a cheerleader he would frequently come up to me after and during work and say, ""You know, I had always wanted to date a cheerleader..."". It just just awkward, but these comments went on and on every day. No specific one seemed overtly disgusting, but I just wished it wasn't happening. There was a lot of drinking and smoking pot and playing games and as the fieldwork progressed it started to feel ""normal"" somehow. It seemed like he really liked me. I started to feel flattered. One night he kissed me. I broke it off, and he started to feel my chest. I told him no, and he persisted a bit but ultimately backed away...but he barely spoke to me for the rest of the fieldwork (many weeks). He found someone else who would sleep with him, which was a very clear message that had been his only plan the entire time. I felt dirty and used, like it was my fault, that I had instigated or encouraged it, and that there was no way I could ever tell anyone because I would be the fool who didn't see it coming. After all, hadn't I been adequately warned? A year or so later I saw him at a conference. I tried to sit away from him at dinner after the talks. He got drunker and drunker, and would not leave me alone. There was dancing. He would dance over to me and comment on how I moved, persistently, trying to touch me. I would just laugh and move away, trying to make light of it. I walked back to my hotel in a group, and said goodbye to them all in the lobby. The next thing I knew, he was calling my room at 3am asking if I could come see him. I had many roommates, one of whom answered the phone. I told him no way, but I'm sure it damaged my reputation. I just never had the guts to try to explain it to anyone. Fortunately, he was a PI at another institution and I never had to deal with him after that. He was married and had two kids the whole time. 2) In 2004 I was a mid-level graduate student and I was doing fieldwork in a different place. There was a senior graduate student who was in a supervisory position (married, with two kids). Several of us took a night off on a weekend to go into a town, and stayed in a hostel. There was drinking. This man got very drunk and was all over me, whispering in my ear ""I'm going to make you come over and over"" and groping me. I told him no, no, no, so many times. I tried to squirm away. I didn't want to make a fuss about it because I had to work with him, and everyone knew him as the ""dirty old man"" anyway so I figured they would just see it as me making a big deal out of nothing. I could not seem to get away from him without raising a fuss. We were in a shared room with several other people and I took the top bunk. He got up there with me, trying to touch me, and I just kept shoving him away with my feet. I really didn't want to make the situation awkward for other people, or for myself when everyone woke up the next morning and had to go back to work together. I must have stayed like that for an hour or more, just shoving his hands back with my feet through my sleeping bag until eventually I guess he just passed out. The next morning he pretended like nothing had happened, and every once in a while I see him and he hugs too long, squeezes too tight...but he does that to all the women, so I feel like if I brought it up I would look conceited. There were rumors that all the men (PIs and male graduate students) would get together and rate the female graduate students and undergraduates on the fieldwork. I can't know if any of that was actually true, but I would not be surprised. 3) In 2016 I was a TT Asst. Prof. I thought all of this was behind me. I am married with two children. I did not think I would be a target any longer, because I was now ""old"" and cynical. I was invited to attend a workshop. Afterwards, several of us colleagues went out...and out...and out. We just kept going from place to place, chatting, having a great time, generating ideas. We were in a group. It felt like my grad school years, but the good parts of them. I chatted for a while with someone who was probably about my age. We knew a lot of the same people, but had never met in person. I showed abundant pictures of my husband and family. He seemed to like seeing them. At the last place, the music was loud. I went to the bathroom and when I came back everyone was gone except for this guy. I asked where they went and he said they had all left. I thought that was weird, and since I had been following the group I didn't really know where I was. I started trying to figure out how to get back to my lodging. A rad song from the 80s started playing and I said I liked it. This guy said I should dance to it then. So we danced, not touching, in a crowd. It was fun - I hadn't done something like that in maybe 10 years. We kept dancing, and he kept getting closer. I kept trying to keep it light, keep my distance, but he kept getting closer and I could not find a way to move away without making it awkward, feeling like he was trying something that I was telling myself he couldn't possibly be trying. After all, he'd seen my family photos and I was no longer a young, naive graduate student right? It just kept happening and I couldn't find a way to stop the situation without bringing attention to it. I felt like that would be awkward, sort of like accusing him of something, which to me felt both conceited and like it could become an issue if we ever worked together in the future. Eventually he pulled me in all of a sudden and planted a huge kiss on my mouth. That was a pretty clear signal that it wasn't all in my head, so I pushed him away and scolded him and reminded him I was happily married. He just smiled and acted like nothing had happened and tried again...and again...after a couple of minutes of trying to ""be normal"" I just gave up and said I needed to go. He walked with me, pretending like nothing had happened. I felt a terrible, awful guilt - just like back in grad school, like I must have been responsible for it simply because I hadn't made a big protest about it at the start. He kept trying to take me on all these detours back to my lodging to ""show me things around the city"". I eventually just got out my phone and found it myself, feeling stupid that I had let that happen on top of everything else. I still feel terrible, like I've done something wrong. I saw him later at a conference and pretended he didn't exist; he did the same. It all felt so childish, stupid, and like being back in high school, which was very distracting when I was supposed to be at a professional conference. Those are just three incidents. They do not include all the many times I have to greet senior men and they hug too long, kiss on the cheek too long, and make comments about my appearance. One committee member told me at my dissertation defense (in front of the crowd) that I sure didn't look like I'd just had a baby (my son was about a month old at the time). It's just tiring.

Shortly after being hired, the PI began sexualizing me; looking down my shirt when talking to me, not taking me seriously as a scientist, very obviously 'checking me out.'

I was then informed that he had a history of harassing undergrads and similar aged employees and was regaled with stories of his highly inappropriate behavior, including why they no longer had evening lab outings due to his inappropriateness. The boss continued to act inappropriately towards me as well as being abusive towards myself and other lab members so I avoided him as much as possible. His approach to science and grant-based research was also suspect at best. During a lunch time holiday outing, he played with my hair and told me I looked like a Disney princess. I was extremely concerned with looking like a 'job hopper' but finally left after 9 months and on my last day, he was nowhere to be found.

Several female students told me stories of being made to feel extremely uncomfortable/threatened personally by his behavior at past events as well, in this same manner. This happened about twice per semester, if not more.  

That this professor, then and now, taught a required course that all undergrads in the major have to take, and some of them have to be dragged kicking and screaming to take it seriously. (I on the other hand LOVE this material.) This guy's behavior and reputation definitely pushed many students away from taking this particular field of study seriously, which deeply upsets me. 

I will also add that several of the other grad students he worked with - before, during, and after my time - are distinctly similar in their approach to undergrads, and one of them started dating an undergrad while in his PhD program, which I felt weird about.

1/11/2018 9:07:04,"In 1992 I was a senior at a Canadian university political studies department. I had applied to a specific grad school and was awaiting response. Our department sponsored a conference and there were speakers from many places, including one luminary from York University whose work I followed and quoted. I was excited to talk to him. He asked me about my plans and when I told him I was waiting to hear from this particular school, he told me that he was in advanced discussion to take a job there as department head and that we should have a further discussion about this. I was over the moon of course because I thought I might get to study with him and maybe he could even help get my application noticed. I was confused and thought “uh-oh” when he suggested we should meet in his room. But I agreed (feeling uneasy and later I blamed myself for this) because I was naive and he said he had his things there or made some potentially plausible excuse about why it made sense. Once we were there he started making not-so-subtle advances after 5 minutes and  I pretended to not realize he was doing it. I kept trying to talk about the grad school. At that point I realized what I had gotten into and I was afraid both for my safety and also for spoiling any chance of getting into the one school I applied to! This mattered greatly because I had a Rotary scholarship to pay for the school but it was dependent upon me getting in. I didn’t know what he would do if I rejected him or if he felt insulted. We basically pranced around the pretext for a while and he finally pressured me for a kiss.  I apologized and told him I had to leave (which I did, unharmed). I worried for a couple months that he would get the job and that I would not be comfortable studying there, if I got in. I did get in and it wasn’t until I arrived at the new school  that I was certain he did not get that job. (This was pre-internet!) Then I was ashamed of myself for years. Every time I saw his book on my shelf, I felt disgusted, but it was an important book to the field so I had to keep it. Finally I threw it out and I no longer feel ashamed. He took advantage of a young lady and it could have affected my career because I would have dropped out of school rather than study with him and I would have lost my full scholarship for that.

I don't know if this is ""wrong."" It feels wrong to me, but is it categorically wrong and something that universities would recognize is wrong? Or am I mistaken about how this whole PhD experience should go? I feel like this is part of the broader problem... women (especially) aren't aware of where they can stand on these gray issues. Anyhow, him and I were very close during my Masters and at the beginning of my PhD, which makes this even harder. During my PhD I became socially isolated and as a result depressed. After I completed coursework and was ABD, I decided to move an hour away from the University to a city that was a healthier living environment that offered more social opportunities for me. He told me I had to live in the town where the university was or he'd take away my funding. I was floored. I argued with him on it, and he eventually said I could move, but he's made my life difficult in many ways since - forcing me to take a class at the University even though my coursework is complete and I've met all departmental requirements, making passive aggressive comments about my whereabouts, embarrassing me by having the head of the department email me to remind me of my duties as a student even if I've moved, etc. I am always terrified to cross him, because he controls my funding.

1/11/2018 7:38:05,My boss's chief of staff (who claims to be gay) would stare at my breasts in one-on-one updates with him about my work. This happened on several occasions. I was perplexed by his behavior. He was also always trying to limit my role in the office. Everyone worked under him in the office and I was a lone wolf who was hired by his boss directly. May be it was his way to make me feel small and uncomfortable. I was very uncomfortable with his stares. This behavior continued for 2.5 years (from Oct 2014 to Dec 2016),Administrative Postdoc,My boss's chief of staff,Elite Institution/Ivy League,University of California Davis ,Administration ,,"The HR told me that if I go against this guy I would never get a decent job again. At every step of the way, it felt like the HR rather than helping me was helping this sick guy. The irony is that HR also reported to this chief of staff (my perpetrator) so how can anyone seek justice. Not only that, the chief compliance officer also reported to this guy.
What is worse is that the chief of staff's boss (who was my boss and who was the boss of my perpetrator) told my perpetrator that I had some grievance against him. I tried to tell my boss that this guy was making me feel very uncomfortable and I wanted to have a conversation with him about it. But the my boss forwarded that private email about my grievances to my perpetrator. My boss insisted that I work with this guy and figure it out. There was no hope of justice there when your own boss is an enabler of such behavior. My boss decided to let a junior postdoc (me) go because I had reported his chief of staff and perhaps he was so comfortable with his chief of staff. I was told eventually that my position is going to get dissolved because of lack of funding. This is after 3 months of telling my boss that I was uncomfortable with his chief of staff.
I still reported my perpetrator and my boss too for the breach of whistleblower protection after getting to know that I was gonna get fired. My perpetrator was in a powerful position and I knew that reporting him would do him no harm. I still went ahead and reported him even though my days in my job were merely numbered. When I met the investigator sent by University of California Office of the President office from Oakland and told him about the harassment and stares of my boss's chief of staff in meetings on my breasts, he asked me a few times are you sure that he was looking at you that way? It was bizarre being questioned whether I was imagining being stared at my breasts and all the unwelcome comments about the dresses I wore and my hair and make up. 
I got another job within a week of getting the news that I am getting fired. I weighed my options and decided that since the whole chain of higher ups were aligned with this perpetrator (especially my boss who was in the highest echelon of UC Davis administration who sent my email of grievances to that sick perp), to not pursue my complaint. ",None,I was given a termination notice within weeks of reporting this guy to the compliance officer. The lack of funding excuse to dissolve my position was just a cover up. It just made me feel disgusted of going further on an administrative career track after getting my PhD. I think all this cry of sexual assault training for guys in positions of power is useless. They create such trainings to keep the activists satisfied but most of these perpetrators go unpunished. ,It was really bad. It elevated my anxiety levels. ,I decided to not ever associate with University of California Davis administration. I found further employment in my academic department (back to working as an academic postdoc). But my stint in administration at the highest level left me with a feeling of deep disgust of how white men are scared of women of color who are ambitious. Even though my perpetrator claims to be gay I have wondered often times how he made me feel small in the meetings by staring at my boobs. How he ridiculed my ideas. How he made so many attempts to make sure I never succeed. ,"The way academic administrations handles sexual assault complaints is just tilted in the favor of perpetrators who are old white men in powerful academic positions. It is a shame when women and men enable such abuse by siding with perpetrators in powerful positions rather than helping the survivors. 

Thank you for giving us a voice by creating this form where victims and survivors of sexual harassment and assault can talk about what they have endured. This effort is great on your part. There are so many stories untold. So many women who have endured abuse of power in academia. We are just scratching the surface. So thanks again. It is a struggle for women of color trying to rise up in the career ladder in academia. So we have to come together and help each other.

I immediately wondered if I had somehow been behaving inappropriately in conversing with pleasure and animation with my former supervisor, whose friendship I enjoy and value.

But, as we all know, microaggressions can cumulatively use up a lot of your energy. Here are just a couple of examples of the kinds of minor episodes I experienced on a near-daily basis in my pre-tenure years, and which still continue to a certain extent. (1) After my chair announced that I would be on parental leave the next semester because I was expecting my first child, my male colleague announced that he knew he'd noticed my ""muffin top"" during our last committee meeting. (2) Same colleague begins a conversation, ""I was walking behind a woman the other day, and at first I thought it was you, only I noticed she lacked a special something in her walk, a little wiggle,  . . .""

No one has ever attempted to coerce me into sex. But gender bias is a longtime constant. For example, in my pre-tenure days, I had one male colleague consistently accuse me of playing the ""mommy card"" any time I tried to schedule a meeting during business hours (he preferred late afternoons to early evenings, thank you very much). His behavior was bullying, incredibly gendered, and interfered with my ability to conduct service in a timely and efficient manner (which in turn affected my research), but, legally speaking, I'm guessing it wouldn't count as ""sexual harassment."" Similarly, when the provost floated my name as a possible Interim Dean, the male Assistant Dean marched to my office and said, ""Well, you know he's only talking about your name because of how you look, right? You'd look good in recruitment brochures."" Does his remark constitute sexual harassment? Or just gender bias? I honestly don't know, but episodes like those above have made my work life a lot harder than it should have been. ","Mental and emotional load: it takes a lot of energy processing these episodes! I used to get so angry, and then I'd have to decide if I wanted to pursue it, and then I would ultimately decide *not* to pursue it, and then I'd spend a lot of energy making myself let it go. I'm better at letting it go these days--and I would say it doesn't happen as often--but a fairly good-sized portion of my brainpower is--at any given time--consumed with how to move around men who have just leveraged gender in one way or another to question or undermine my authority.

1/9/2018 11:25:58,"December 1990. I had graduated from my B.A. in French, and was in France for a year. My advisor invited me to meet him and his wife for coffee one evening. Because I had babysat their two children through my undergraduate studies, I thought it was a lovely gesture, and agreed to meet them. The venue changed from a coffee house to a bar--again, not a problem, because I knew them well. I arrived, and my advisor was in his car smoking a joint, and beckoned to me to get in the car with him. He said that his wife couldn't make it, and asked if I wanted to go see a particularly gawdy Christmas light display with him nearby. He started the car, and drove toward it, then parked. He grabbed my hand and shoved it between his legs, and pulled me close. I was so stunned, I didn't know what to do, but pulled away while he told me of his stress getting tenure, then having terrible reviews from his graduate students the semester before. He kept talking, then drove back to the bar. We went inside, and I tried to act as though nothing was strange, then left quickly after finishing a beer.
I was upset, but thought he was high and would forget about a lapse in judgement. I did go to graduate school, and was forced to take a sparsely attended rhetoric class that he was teaching, because ***'s class was full. It was a topic I loved, but throughout the class, my professor continued to harass me, suggesting first that my paper was brilliant (but only gave me a B+), and offered to help me in his library carrel. I didn't go. He gave me information about a conference, and told me that I should submit a paper there. I hesitated, and he called me one night, asking me if I was going, so he would be sure to go, too. I didn't submit a proposal--even though it would have been a great opportunity for a first semester master's student. 
I avoided him for the rest of my studies, and did well. I was given a paid position assisting the editor of a major journal, and the graduate advisor asked me to stay for my PhD. 
Unfortunately, my professor presented a question on my master's exam that I could never have anticipated--it had nothing to do with my studies, and did not allow me to demonstrate what I did know, and so far from what other students were given that I was blown away. I knew a little--it was related to a French psychologist--and tried to answer, but was absolutely devastated, and sat in the exam sobbing for two hours before trying to write--about two pages, actually--then leaving. All the events in the car, and for that semester, came back to me, and I realized that he wanted me gone.
In my orals, the department head sat beside me, and reassured me as I talked about the other questions. The question from my harasser did not come up once, and I tried to mention it (had become nearly an expert by the time of those exams!), but the committee kept switching the topic, and then said that the question was ""unusual"". The harassing professor did not say much at all that day, which was very unlike him. 
The following week, the graduate advisor told me that he was ashamed of my written exam, and told me that I was not allowed to return. I did, however, pass my master's exam. I really felt that they wanted to get rid of me quickly and quietly.
I am incredibly grateful, in particular, to one professor, who believed me. He was excluded from my exam process because they scheduled the exam while he was on an extended trip to Brazil. He told me that he felt this had been intentional. He was extremely well regarded (***'s biographer, among other things), so it meant a lot to me that he tried to help me.

The male colleague and I had nearly identical committees (including the same dissertation chair) and were at the same stage, i.e., ready for defense and graduation.  One of our reading committee members, TL, withheld his signature so that I could not set a final defense date and insisted on reviewing my statistical analyses in detail; however, TL allowed the male colleague to set a defense date (August 3) with no prior review of his statistical analyses.  During June-July 1990, I endured four 2-3 hour meetings with TL reviewing statistical printouts (at one point, taking a phone call and asking the [unknown] caller whether they thought my analysis strategy was ""stupid"").  TL demanded that I conduct analysis and put them in the dissertation; then at the next meeting, he'd insist I take them out.  Another committee member (CL) who held a joint appointment in the statistics department had no concerns with either my analysis strategy or findings.  I reached a breaking point in late July, when another faculty member intervened with my dissertation chair, who evidently talked TL into allowing me to set a defense date.  The defense date (August 16)  required me to change my travel plans (I'd accepted a job 2300 miles away and was flying out to begin teaching in late August).  My defense ran nearly three hours (most other students' defenses were less than two hours), and when the committee called me back into the room, TL said (twice) ""Congratulations, Dr. [name of male colleague].""  TL demanded additional changes that required me to register and pay for fall quarter tuition, and when I sent them he delayed reviewing the final document so long that I feared I'd have to fly back for a second defense (the university required another defense if the final document was submitted after more than 60 days).  In the end, it cost me $1500+, a gigantic hit to my self-esteem, and an incredibly stressful start to my new job.  About 6-7 years later, he pulled the same routine with another female student who asked him to chair her committee.

1/9/2018 0:18:24,"Grad school; a star professor clearly and persistently hitting on/ flirting with another (female) classmate.  This caused a great deal of difficulty in the class, because the rest of us felt that she was getting special treatment because she was pretty.  We were inclined to blame her for being flirtatious.  At the same time she was very disturbed by it and made a point of not being alone with him. 

This (married) prof had a reputation for hitting on female students but always ""waited to be asked""; was rumoured to have had several affairs with students (his wife had been a former student, but also others, both before and after my time). This introduced sexual competition into an environment in which we should have been judged for intellectual activity only.

He also had a favourite undergraduate student, admittedly brilliant, who spent hours alone in his office with him and flaunted this to everyone else; again causing other students to feel as if we had to compete for his attention through sexual attractions rather than through intellectual prowess.  And this element of sexual competition introduced rivalry where it should not have been.  So, for example, I didn't like either of these students simply because they got his (sexualized) attention.  This should not have been an issue.  They were not the problem.  He was the problem.

And here I want to mention an issue that I'm not sure if others have mentioned.  Partly because I knew he was ""available"", I had a huge crush on him. I did nothing about it, and avoided him as much as I could because I was ashamed of how I felt.  It felt like my fault; that I was the one was sexualizing the environment by having a crush on him.  And I think that female students, in particular, tend to often have crushes on male profs; and it is the prof's job - because he's the one with the power - to downplay that, ignore it, and desexualize the environment as much as they can (which, obviously, he didn't.)  But I felt as if I was to blame. And I was jealous as hell of the students he was paying that kind of attention to.  Was I not pretty enough? Was I not smart enough?  This complicated grad school. And I should say: this paragraph was hard to write.  I am still ashamed of myself and still blame myself. Perhaps rightly. I finished my degree 25 years ago.

1/8/2018 12:37:25,"Three years ago, my department head e-mailed a sexual joke to all the faculty in our department. The joke consisted of a picture of a construction sign that had a misspelling that made the sign have an unintended sexual meaning (in our department's foreign language).

Then at our department meeting that week, this same department head asked the two women present (not the other male faculty) if they had gotten the joke.

It became obvious that my gender was a problem for this professor. I lost so much self-esteem due to the toxic atmosphere created by my department chair that I stopped presenting at conferences and submitting publications, judging myself to no longer be worthy of such activities.

I avoid him at all costs, but do not understand why I am made to feel like I did something wrong, especially since nothing happened to him.","I cried in my car after the meeting, as I had done many times after inappropriate remarks or situations. The toxic atmosphere created by my chair had a deep impact on my academic self esteem, which I didn't realize for a long time. I had felt quite happy to be a full-time adjunct, even after I started being ""adjunctified"" , my little term for being made to feel ""less than"" by others in academic departments or institutions (not being allowed to attend faculty meetings at one institution, being addressed in the third person and summarily dismissed from conversations at a large public university, being treated as less important adjunct compared to other positions that included a search...). Being an adjunct was hard enough, but sexual harassment and gender bias on top of this were overwhelming. I also became physically afraid of my department chair after seeing him lash out at another tenured professor over a very simple matter to the point that I thought he was going to hit the other professor (the entire ghastly fight witnessed by another student and taking place during a search interview, no less). I was supposed to present a paper at a conference, and I found myself unable to finish the paper, but I didn't understand why for a long time, because I've never had any problem finishing my work, even when I was dealing with difficult personalities in my work life. But this was different. This treatment hit me at my core, particularly since I am a survivor of rape. Thankfully I already had a good therapist, and I was able to work through this experience with her and figure out next steps. I have never experienced such a profound loss of faith in someone as the moment when I realized that my chair's inappropriate behavior was connected to his opinion of my career potential.

1/7/2018 10:31:33,"Inappropriate touching, by a prestigious senior professor. I was a doctoral student considering applying for a scholarship for which he was one of the decision-makers. I was making copies at the department at night, and he entered in the room and looked at the article I was copying. I mentioned my project, advisor support, and interest in applying for the said scholarship. He then abruptly reached into my blouse, where a long family necklace was lodged, and took it out, from in between my breasts. I was flabbergasted. I just remember saying it belonged to my grandparents, then disappeared and lost faith in the scholarship fairness process. Needless to say I gave up ever meeting with him again, even if there was a perfect match for my research.
A second incident with another senior prestigious professor in the same department. I was working on a research paper in the field of this senior new hire, and was enthusiastic about his work. I was done with my classes, but would audit his classes, and come often to his office hours with questions, for more than a year. He was injured for months, and I was very sympathetic with his circumstances. As I made progress in my work, and by chance met his wife, he mostly wanted to discuss his personal life with me. I thought he was not ok then, but did not take it personally. Then, out of the blue, he asked me out, despite his marriage and my own committed relationship. I was profoundly disappointed - particularly given my interest in his field of research, and my expectations of his character. All the investment in intellectual interaction went to waste - no way I would be able to have him in my committee or to provide comments about my project.

Also, no letter of recommendations for jobs could be asked for said senior professors in my field, and there was no time to establish other intellectual conversations with other professors - adversely affecting my career prospects.","I had to seek psychological support, which was very helpful, to not internalize the implicit social norms going on at the department, and for moving on.

This person then touched my knee - and this was all behind a closed door. He was not necessarily my mentor, but he was most certainly my supervisor as a grad assistant and my professor. I was scared and didn't know how to react. I was afraid I would lose my job and lose my health insurance, and I was living 1000 miles from home and from my dad (who was dying at the time this harassment occurred) so needless to say I didn't know how to react. I told a female PhD program professor about it a couple of months after it happened and she seemed to understand, but did not provide me any support nor did she tell me that as an administrator of a different program within the same department, she was tasked per university policy to report him. She didn't report him, and she did not speak up when he ended up on my comps grading committee at the last minute. I failed my comps - something I blame on his participation in my grading, my dealing with the death of my father, my dealing with a department that did not support me after his death and did not care I was so bothered by what my harasser did and the fact that I just couldn't prepare as I should have with all that baggage. After telling a fellow student about this and avoiding my harasser as much as possible (e.g. not being in a room alone with him, not raising my hand in his class, seeking out the associate head of the program when I needed something), I reported him to the university's EOC. They told me I let too much time pass to file a formal complaint and that I should be lucky it wasn't as bad as other instances they knew about on campus. I then went to the Office of Faculty Affairs about it and was told I should learn to avoid him when I needed to be in the building. I became so anxious about coming to work and felt so depressed over the death of my father and how I felt alone in a city and at a university that had no interest in my success. I started to drink more and go out more - anything to take my mind off the environment I was in. I finally reported him to who I thought was my mentor and asked him not to tell anyone but to just help me overcome this issue. He took it upon himself to report it to the dept chair who then told my harasser I was causing a problem for him. When I asked why my name had to be brought up, the dept chair said while he didn't have to tell my harasser who was causing a problem for him, he felt it was the right thing to do so he could face his accuser. Of course this caused further hardship for me because it seemed as if they were protecting him, not supporting me. My mentor began referring to me by Ms. (my last name) instead of just my first name like he usually did. He sat with me and the female PhD professor I first told about the harassment for one hour one time under the guise because I asked them to please help me pass my comps, but when I let on how frustrated I was and got tears in my eyes, the female professor made a face, implied I had mental problems, and asked if I needed to leave the room to get myself together. I took my comps twice more and failed out of the program.  I wrote a lengthy letter to the university president and received a response that said her office reached out to the dept and that a ""counter-narrative emerged from those conversations, supported in some cases with rather compelling documentation. I have no doubt that you were sorely disappointed in your experience in the department and really do wish it had been otherwise. However, your failing out of the program was also very disappointing to those in the department who sincerely believe they attempted to work with and support you to the extent that they could. It was, in essence, a mutually disappointing experience for all concerned. I asked the department to think seriously about what they might have done differently to facilitate a more positive outcome. I ask you to do the same."" Because I failed out of the program, I lost my job and my health insurance. I had to rely on the other adjunct teaching jobs I had to work to pay my bills and on unemployment for a while. I left teaching as soon as I found the first full-time job that hired me. I left my research interests behind, I left students behind, etc. That part was probably for the best. If what I experienced is what academia is, I don't belong there. And maybe I just didn't have what it takes to cut it in a PhD program - that I can accept. But it would've been nice to find that out based solely on my lack of success, not on being harassed, having to hide in hallways to avoid my harasser, being a part of a university that did not care about my success or my well-being and being in a culture that dismissed me and so fiercely protected my harasser.

1/3/2018 23:28:08,"February 2002 during the campus interview for my current job, where I was hired, and where I also subsequently earned tenure and promotion. The search committee chair picked me up from the airport and took me to dinner in town, where we had a friendly discussion about our common roots in California while he guzzled two beers, after which he brought me to my hotel. Rather than dropping me off (which would have seemed pretty normal), he escorted me to the check in desk, collected my room key for me, then took my suitcase from me and walked it to the elevator. This struck me as odd, but I assumed he would bid me good evening at the elevator door. Wrong. On the second floor, I practically had to run after him (he, still dragging my luggage), and thought surely he'd have to hand over my room key at the door... Wrong again. He entered my room, walked my bag over to the bedside table, and began scribbling something on the pad next to the bed: his phone number, in case I needed to reach him, he said. For what felt like an eternity, he stood there in the room looking at me in silence, until I stuck my arm straight out to shake his hand uncomfortably. I thanked him for his help, told him I'd see him in the morning. I remember thinking to myself: how do you remain courteous and professional and at the same time make it resolutely clear that this guy needs to clear out PRONTO? Nothing happened to me that night, and ultimately, I was offered the job. Still, I have no doubt this man behaved in a manner that was inappropriate.

I inadvertently learned, on another occasion, that he  passed off a verbatim copy of one of my course syllabi as his own, without ever mentioning it or asking my permission.

1/3/2018 22:17:58,"From the perspective of my 20 year old brain, we spent a lot of time together, got along exceptionally well, and had a lot in common. I suppose there was flirting. I adored the attention. We spent one summer creating a unique database together for a new project, so spent 8 hour days in his office together sometimes. One day, he tried to kiss me. I leaned away uncomfortably, surprised, and he rushed out of the office. Later, he told me I made him feel so awful by pulling away that he vomited. I did not pull away the second time. We wound up in a relationship. Seventeen years and an incredible amount of institutional power separating us. Obviously I was mature enough to make these sorts of choices for myself, right? Any time there was conflict or, even worse, I contemplated ending it, I feared my graduate school and thus career prospects would be ruined. So I stayed for awhile. And at times, even believed I was happy about that.

As a late 30-something assistant professor, the story is very different for me now. He clearly groomed me. He made himself the most important figure in my academic life as an undergraduate hoping to pursue a graduate degree. And he took advantage of that. The relationship was emotionally manipulative and abusive. And continued to be as such periodically for many years even after the relationship theoretically ended.

Once we were done, he moved through a series of other undergraduate women over the course of several years. Eventually he married and had children with one.

1/3/2018 19:32:39,"FYI: My example is an outlier as it has to do with a colleague harassing me after I transitioned from male to female. I don't want to distract from the other stories but be a supplement to them by providing an example that likely has some parallel others with regard to the negative effect dealing with the harassment has had on me and my career.

After earning tenure, I transitioned from male to female. What I experienced was sexual harassment in the form of purposeful mis-gendering of me by a colleague in my department. I kept trying to get him to stop by personal interventions as I had no desire to ""out"" myself to any more people at the university which would happen if I made a formal complaint. However after 5 years of it I finally filed a formal complaint. When I finally did make the complaint, an ally in the department remarked at how patient I had been with the perpetrator. This is when things got much worse. 

The dean, chair, and the Human Rights people did their best to address the complaint but the perpetrator stymied them as much as he could which was very stressful to me as his office was next to mine and we had to work in the same department during the investigation. The uncertainty of when the investigation would finish along with not knowing if it would be in my favor was extremely distracting. It was also very worrying as if he was found non-guilty then he would basically have carte blanche to keep doing what he had been doing.

Things got much worse when the perpetrator appealed the decision of the human rights office investigation that he be removed from the department. The perpetrator hired a lawyer and I had to read extremely transphobic statements about me in their prepared rebuttal statement. The appeal was also drawn out with me now having to make a statement to the appeals board to defend myself. The worrying about the appeal being granted and my perpetrator being let back into my department caused even more distraction and depression.

During the appeal process I learned the one of my colleagues (a woman full prof) was testifying on my perpetrator's behalf and that one of the appeals board members was obviously hostile to me.

Eventually the original finding was upheld but I still lost due to all of the worry and distraction that caused major depression which also severely affected my professional efforts.

1/3/2018 17:48:33,"A senior prof in another program petitioned the college president against me for no apparent reason. (My research, service, and teaching were all better than his.) Ultimately this cost me tenure. I know about this because after I was denied tenure -- after being voted up by the Division, faculty evaluation committee, and dean -- the prof in question started harassing a technician who had worked with me and was a good acquaintance. Prof repeatedly told the tech that the tech was having gay sex with me (we were not; we are both straight white men, the tech is married to a woman), continually bullied the tech, made lewd sexual gestures and sounds of the tech engaging in oral sex, would not let the tech avoid this harassment, referred to the tech as the prof in question's ""nigger"", his ""bitch"", and said there was nothing the tech could do about the prof treating him like this. Eventually this affected the technician's health. I knew about none of these events at the time, but the tech sued the college (Title IX) and this information all came out. By then it was well past any window where I could appeal tenure (there is only a 2-week window to announce an appeal at that college). The college settled with the technician out of court in exchange for a non-disclosure agreement from the tech, which the tech has honoured, and the prof in question was stripped of his status as Program Chair. The prof counter-sued and won on procedural grounds. Or maybe the college settled. You can look up the result, it's online. While this was going on the prof in question started following the tech's wife, who works on campus, and blocked her ability to drive off campus at one point. Those actions led to the local police enacting a restraining order on the prof in question. The tech got a high school teaching job and left the college. I was denied tenure and moved twice for other jobs. The irony is that I barely spoke to the prof in question; why he petitioned the president against me is anyone's guess. He had a reputation for being unstable (which was clearly true), and I gave him a lot of room.

At other institutions the chem prof would have been fired. The impact of harassment on the health of the tech was large. He evidently got to the point where he'd vomit before coming to work because of the stress of working with the chemistry prof, above. Again, I only found out about this after the fact.","I work at a great college now. I like it very much. In many, many ways my situation is much better now. But, I still don't have tenure, and the standards here are much higher. I also do not have the financial stability (or any other kind) that comes with tenure. I am 5 years older and well past the age of being easily hired anywhere else. The technician is a high school teacher. My impression is that he is happy in his current position.

After a short conversation he took my hand and said something along the lines of ""you will be at the reception won't you.""

I was asking him for advice on my presentation and he said that he was ""too busy imagining what was under my dress"" to listen to what I was saying. He whispered that in my ear and placed his hand on my lower back. After I pulled away, he persisted, groping me (including my upper thigh, underneath my skirt) and demanding that I return with him to his hotel room. He additionally accused me of sleeping with my co-author to gain first authorship on my publication. At one point he told me that he and his wife ""had an understanding""; and later that I owed him a kiss, at the very least, which I refused.

1/2/2018 8:25:11,"As a graduate student getting my education paid for with a graduate assistantship in an athletic department. So, I'm not sure this is exactly what you are looking for. I was propositioned by 2 of the men's basketball coaches, one of which was the head coach. The incident with the head coach was at a athletic department function that was held at a bar. Near the end of the evening, he came up close behind me while I waited to order a drink and whispered into my ear, ""What's your favorite position?"". I tried to laugh it off and give an half answer as to not offend him, but then he offered me  ride home. I ignored that question and waited for him to be distracted - and when he finally was, I left the event without saying goodbye to anyone. The second occurrence in the same athletic department was after I lost my brother tragically. I was invited to lunch by another coach that had also had a family tragedy in his past. At some point over lunch, I was informed that if I ever needed to be with someone, sexually, he was available. He went on to normalize this discussion by saying everyone should have sex at least once a week and that it didn't need to be more than that. I was numb from the pain of losing my brother, so this wasn't as shocking as maybe it should have been. I didn't take him up on his offer, either. I told my boyfriend about both of these incidents, but he was a graduate student as well and we both knew that making the basketball coaches upset could put us at risk. They were both really nice people and that is hard to reconcile. I had to continue to work with both of them, in limited ways, and socialize with them at department functions, and neither ever brought up me declining their offers. I do have to say though, these instances were taking into consideration when I decided to change careers and no longer pursue my dream of being a collegiate coach. I didn't feel threatened but I didn't want to be in an environment where this type of behavior was accepted and, in a way, expected. This occurred at the highest level and I still feel guilt about what I didn't say to ensure others felt comfortable at work. This wasn't a big deal to me, I have years of experience of finding a way to turn down men without making them feel bad for approaching me. But, for those that are more vulnerable, they shouldn't have to feel this pressure. And honestly, I shouldn't have to think about the men's feelings when I say no. I should just be allowed to say no and go on about my business.

I was an undergrad in NE Ohio with anticipation of applying to my school's graduate program. Over the course of the semester in my stats class, a classmate constantly pressured me to help him study. Miscommunications, combined with my not wanting to hurt his feelings, led to a never-ending night of trying to fend off his aggressive advances that literally left over 15 dark bruises from my torso to my neck. I left his dorm in the early morning, and when I left he asked if I would leave my homework assignment and told me that he would return it before class that day. I left the assignment, but he was late to class and turned in both of our assignments to the professor at the end of class. The professor publicly reprimanded us for plagiarism and we were not given credit for the assignment. I was mortified. I never explained the incident to the professor and he never asked about it. I do believe that the incident is the reason why the prof ignored my follow-up inquiries about a project he had previously invited me to become involved with. I also wondered if the story of academic dishonesty circulated among other faculty within the department.

12/31/2017 10:51:57,"Over a period of five years (2009-2014), a tenured male faculty member at the university's interdisciplinary honors college sexually harassed at least three junior and contingent faculty women in his field. During this period, X was the sole senior faculty member in his discipline and he repeatedly abused this role. His harassment of others has been witnessed and tolerated by other male tenured faculty. Incidents which I experienced and/or documented to support other complaints reported to the University’s Office of Equity, Inclusion and Compliance Office include the following: X asked a junior faculty woman waiting for a colleague outside her office door if she was wearing a bra because he could not see any visible bra straps. He then asked if it was a strapless bra. When the questions were ignored, he asked if it was a corset. He stated that he wanted to buy a corset for his wife for Valentine’s Day and wanted to know where she bought her underwear. X regularly interrupted work-related discussion to insert stories about sex acts / behavior with no warning (i.e.  in response to ordinary pleasantries, would say that he had loud sex with his wife to make his live-in father-in-law uncomfortable /  in response to a typical “how is class prep going?” made repeated references to storing and watching pornography on his work computer, blaming the pornography for the poor performance of his computer and expressing anxiety about what the IT staff would find when they examined his computer). At a dinner with a job candidate, X asked a junior faculty member to dance on the table to entertain them while they waited for food to arrive. X asked a newly hired faculty member if he could move in with her as a tenant. When she refused, he sent two emails containing sexually explicit material and a professional attack. In the first email, a woman dressed as a schoolgirl sings about having sex with older men. The second email claims that the degree held by the recipient is a worthless degree. He spoke in a graphic sexual manner to a junior faculty woman during a meeting at which two male tenured professors were present and in which he stated that he pictured the woman in pornographic films. One of the two male tenured faculty members told him to “quit while he was behind.” He then stated that he regularly imagined the junior faculty woman in pornographic films. Immediately following the meeting, he approached her alone in her office and encouraged her to make money writing for erotic publishers. He then went on to quote graphically from this style of writing, giving the example of erotica that contains “pulling back the folds and thrusting.” At this point, the faculty member put her hand up and repeatedly shouted “Enough! Enough! Enough!” During a student conference, X loudly (so as to be overheard) stated to a student that a junior faculty woman was having an affair with a colleague. When the faculty member immediately confronted him, he told her that “sex scandals were no big deal.” X made repeated comments to junior faculty women about clothes, body, and weight changes. These comments range from sexual innuendos to comments about weight loss to specific comments about how their bodies looked in various outfits to descriptions of faculty members who did not work out as lazy. He regularly used these statements about weight as a way to invite faculty to look at photographs of his body posted online in speedos for bodybuilding competitions. X made repeated comments to women faculty about how hearing their high heels in the hall caused him to sexually fantasize about them. I can think of few interactions with him in that five year period that he did not sexualize. ",Junior faculty,"Tenured faculty at the same partner campus, different college",R2,Public Florida University,,,"Response within his college: His behavior was well-known and tolerated even when witnessed directly by other faculty. The Dean took no action to curb him. One junior faculty woman was told by another male tenured faculty mentor within the college that since X was the sole senior faculty member in her discipline, a letter from him was necessary for a tenure file and that it would “look weird” to not have his endorsement. 
Response by the university’s OEIC: A number of the above incidents were documented with OEIC in 2014 and 2016. My own 2016 meeting was prompted by the university’s decision to move him directly across from my office in response to a separate complaint lodged against him by another woman faculty member. Since my experiences occurred more than 180 days earlier (the internal timeline for investigations), the university lawyer suggested that I could stay in my office as a “guinea pig” to see if more recent actions within their 180 day window could be documented. I refused. I instead requested (and was granted) a transfer to the main campus instead from my department chair. This year, I re-sent the complaint along with a time-stamped letter documenting conversation with a junior faculty woman that detailed sexual harassment by him. I did so because I was scheduled to teach a spring course back on that campus and wanted to be sure that his history of sexual harassment was documented since the lawyer to whom I made my complaint had left. The OEIC copied my department chair though the chair did not appear on any of my emails to OEIC and I had never told the chair about the harassment. OEIC wrote that they should only be contacted in the future with “current and new allegations.” OEIC did not respond to my email asking if copying direct supervisors or chairs on sexual harassment response was standard for their office. 
University Administration response: In response to my question to the university president at a recent faculty senate as to whether copying supervisors on sexual harassment complaints was standard procedure for the university’s OEIC office, he stated that the OEIC had experienced a lot of turnover and currently lacked leadership but that they were in the process of hiring. In response to my question about the 180 day rule, the president indicated in his responses that he would be willing to review the university policies with respect to the internal 180 day rule.   
",OEIC never contacted me following my complaint since incidents fell outside 180 day period. His office was moved in response to another complaint.

I was never on campus outside of required office hours.

The colleague did not know my story when he told me and it was the first he had heard of this behavior from this person. (I of course had heard since I was a graduate student that he was a predator). My colleague was shocked but I suddenly realized that the offender's pattern of behavior was essentially a lifestyle and that someone (me) had to report it.  However, because there was no evidence (beyond the emails) and especially because none of the incidents took place while I was still at the institution where the offender worked (same for the other victim), no action was taken beyond a minor verbal reprimand.",None that I know of.,"The incident has lead me to allocate much more of my time to all issues surrounding sexual harassment including service to multiple scientific societies, advocating for sexual harassment training and policies, receiving training myself, mentoring of others on these issues, etc. This is on top of 'normal' academic service (editorial work, dept and university committees, outreach), so it certainly reduces my research output, but I have to at least try to turn the tide.","It was traumatic (particularly the reporting and associated process) and stressful.

Anyway, this is why I put more than one institution -- sure, the offender made inappropriate comments to me while I was still a PhD student in the department, but the major onslaught of harassment was not until I was at a different institution.  I think those early comments where just testing the waters and laying the groundwork for the full hit after graduation.

12/21/2017 16:16:55,"A group of us graduate students were out at a local bar across from our University on a Friday night. We were there to mostly get free food during happy hour. As usual, there were more male grad students than female in the group, but I was not the only female student.  A group of 4 male professors sat at a table next to us and you could see that they were talking about us - pointing, particularly at me, and talking. I had recently won an award, so I wondered if perhaps they were talking about that. (duh, in hindsight, pretty stupid of me to think they cared about my brain or scientific expertise).  

Finally they came to some kind of agreement and decided which one of them would come talk to us. They shook hands and one of them came over to join us. He made a lot of small talk and was really nice to us, and as graduate students we were all flattered that this professor wanted to hang out with us. Everyone in the group thought this was great when he said he wanted to go with us to the next place. He offered to give us (several of us, not just me) a ride to the next bar to help us be safer and have a designated driver. We already had one or two others doing this too, so we all just went out to the parking lot to jump in the cars of the designated drivers, and go to the next place. 

When we got out to the cars, it ended up that I was the only person left who needed a ride, so I ended up in his car. (in hindsight I think he planned it this way) Instead of driving me to the next bar where all my friends went, he insisted on stopping off at his house first, and he insisted that I come in with him. I was too trusting, because I didn't know this person very well but, he was a professor, so I should trust him right? He acted like it was fine. 

So I went inside with him, and stood in the kitchen waiting for him to get whatever it was he needed to pick up. He came in the kitchen, and grabbed my sunglasses off the top of my head, saying something to the effect that I didn't need those while inside. He set them back off to the side in the kitchen and I thought how strange that was, since putting them so far back there is very likely going to result me forgetting them when I leave. So I made a point to remember that they were there. I thought that was so weird because we were only supposed to be there for a minute while he picked something up. He insisted on getting me a glass of water, so I took it and started to drink it. 

He then went into his bedroom, telling me that it was his bedroom (some door off the living room - I think it was only a 1 bedroom house) also thinking why does he need to tell me that room is his bedroom? I don't care, just get what you need and let's go, my friends are waiting. 

Then he came back into the kitchen, and he threw me against the wall, hard,  and kissed me roughly. He was trying to push me into the bedroom and telling me that I wanted it, that I must want it otherwise I would have never come into his house. 

I was completely shocked and not ready for any of this, but I fought back, very hard, and turns out I was pretty strong. I also screamed NO at him and I essentially threw him across the small room in my anger. His back and head smashed against the kitchen cabinets. He then tried furiously to keep my sunglasses, which I am 99% certain, was going to be his way of ""proving"" he 'had' me or whatever bet those 4 professors made when they were at their table staring at us and shook hands on. I had to physically fight him for the sunglasses and rip them out of his hands. I think I was still screaming at him too. I then ran out the door. 

I had to walk, a very, very, long way, home. crying.

12/21/2017 15:38:16,"I was turning in one of the written portions of my Comprehensive Exam for my PH.D. When I came to my professor's office, he got up and shut the door. I thought that was weird, but I thought, perhaps he had something he wanted to tell me?? I was standing at the front of his desk and said ""here's my written exam, the oral exam will be on xx date and xx time"". This professor stepped to the side of his desk, unzipped his pants, pulled his dick out and said ""You can take your oral exam right here. And I guarantee that you'll pass"". The coldest sweat of pure fear covered me from head to toe and I was racking my brain to figure out how to get out of this -- and still manage to pass the real exam in the next couple of days!! I quickly decided to act like he was joking, and I said ""Ha ha, very funny! See you Monday!"" and ran away. 

I told 2 other (male) professors about the incident. One was my advisor and he said that I was lying. (The professor who did this was a full professor and powerful, my advisor was not yet tenured and I think he felt he perhaps had no choice but to side against me in this-maybe?. I will never know). 

The second professor was not on my committee. He was shocked, but he believed me. He said that the University had nothing in place to protect me. When this happened, the door was closed, it would be a 'he-said, she-said"" and I would lose. Word would get out in the community of scientists if I reported it, and not only would I perhaps not graduate with my Ph.D., but no one would hire me. They would think that I might be the type of person to 'cry rape' when doing fieldwork and no man would want to trust me to work with them. 

I was more than sick to my stomach, and sick at the thought of this person continuing to do this to others, some of whom might not get out of the situation as I had managed to do. But he was right, I could not report it if I wanted a career in this field - one I had been working on for 10 yrs (BS, MS, and PHD degrees). I had no choice but to not report it. 

I did pass my comprehensive exam, but my advisor allowed this perpetrator to ask questions first to try and upset me. I did not let him get to me (god knows how, probably because I was so angry). 

This professor continued to harass me multiple times before I finally graduated and got away. I had to go with him the field, alone - there were no other choices if I wanted to graduate, and while driving 4WD on a really awful road, he play acted like we might get stuck (the road was bad. we really needed to stop and hike in from there). He said 'I'm going to get this stuck and then we'll have to spend the night here and I'm going to sleep with you"". I insisted that he stop and we walk in from there. I managed to get through that day and get home without being assaulted, but there were numerous comments like this one that were incredibly upsetting and I was ready to flee or fight the entire time. 

Another time, on a large field trip with many many other professors and students, this same professor walked by me and said quietly so no one else could hear that he would be coming over to my tent in the night to sleep with me. I laid there awake all night scared to death. I did hear him during the night come out of his tent (we all had tents pretty close together), and I heard him walk over to my tent (I was freaking out, wondering how I survive this, because yelling and waking people up would just result in ME having trouble because I know he would say that I asked him in or some other lie and that no matter what choice I made, I would be the one to suffer). Luckily, he stopped just outside of my tent, and I heard him piss right next to my tent in the night. But then he went back to his tent. It was awful. 

During the time of all these actions (over a year), this professor was sleeping with an undergraduate that he picked up over the previous summer from the field camp he taught. We, as graduate students, all knew about this. At a conference meeting, the opening night this professor came over to me and told me this long sob story of how his wife was leaving him (she had found out about the affair) and how he had cancer. He didn't say what kind of cancer but he alluded to it having something to do with his genitals. I was supposed to feel sorry for him. 

When I told my friends (other graduate students) we put two and two together and decided that he probably caught some VD from the student he was sleeping with and didn't bother to tell his doctor and thus he really didn't have cancer but had VD. But!! Several times during these months, he also told me that if I didn't sleep with him, he would make sure that I never got a job (I was just months from graduating with my Ph.D.). To avoid this, whenever I applied for jobs, I did NOT put him down as a reference. At some of my interviews, people would ask why his name wasn't there, since he had been my MS advisor and they expected a letter from him. I was able to get out of the situation because I could tell them that he had cancer, and thus I didn't want to put an additional load on him by having him write me letters. Whew. Saved by his lie. (BTW, the issue of cancer never came up again from him, so we all assume that he actually never did have cancer). 

I was finally able to get a job and LEAVE. I have had to avoid him for my entire career and I still feel bad that he probably has other victims out there and if things had been different, could I have done something to have prevented some of those? I'll never know.

12/21/2017 9:54:29,"An Associate Vice-President in Facilities & Operations bullied many people over the years both men and women. His patterns of behaviour included intimidation, humiliation, false rumours, undermining and isolation. He withheld information, belittled people, yelled at them in front of their peers and used funding as a way to control people and outcomes. In meetings there were off-colour jokes, some of which were demeaning for women. Some of the Associate Vice-President's staff were also modelling the same behaviour. 

This pattern of behaviour was well-known to the Vice-President but he did not do anything about it. As the behaviour escalated, people began sharing their experiences with each other. More and more people were identified as being affected. I experienced: heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, fear for my reputation and for loss of my job. I had a hard time focusing on my role and spent a lot of time questioning my confidence and abilities. I avoided being in the alone with the Associate Vice-President at all costs. 

The situation was heavily reported to Human Resources, the Office of Safe Disclosure and the Vice President but nothing was done. When a particularly bad incident happened to a colleague it became the catalyst for a group of people to bring it forward to the Faculty Association. They pressured the university to take action or risk a broad grievance for failure to take action.

The Office of Safe Disclosure said they would do an investigation if more than one person came forward. When more people came forward they did not take action. The Office of Safe Disclosure is poorly staffed, and seems to have limited tools or support to address bullying. They are well armed to address issues related to the violation of human rights. 

The outgoing Vice-President was retiring and while he committed to dealing with the Associate Vice-President before he left nothing was ever done. New Vice-President inherited a mess and has been attempting to address the issue. 

The only way to get action is to press a formal charge against an employee through the Faculty Association. Pressing a formal charge means that the perpetrator will know the name of their accusers.

An email from the two mentioned only concerns about his ""alleged interaction with university students."" At the meeting, he says, their casual tone and his own belief that he had done nothing wrong prompted him to candidly discuss having dated an undergraduate after she finished taking a course from him. The 2012 meeting turned out to be ""a setup,"" recalls the former Michigan faculty member, who spoke to The Chronicle on the condition that it not identify him because he and the woman he had dated already have been harassed online. The administrators, he says, soon used statements against him as part of a sexual-misconduct investigation. Months later, officials there declared that he had violated ""the spirit of"" a university rule barring romantic relationships between instructors and their students. He faced sanctions that included a salary freeze and a three-year postponement of his eligibility for tenure, which he had been on the verge of receiving.

12/20/2017 12:41:23,"At a conference, I went to drinks with another graduate student and a recently tenured faculty member - both cis-male.

This was the second assault.",Graduate Student,TT Fac at another institution in the same field,Other R1,,Geography,,"I spoke to another faculty from my institution at the conference and asked for help. She urged me to talk to a female faculty on my committee. When we talked about it, she told me that she had to deal with that until she was 50. Also, there are ""known perpetrators"" that I should avoid.",none,"I no longer drink at conferences (unless it is at a party thrown by my department - and then it is only one). I will not go to lunch or coffee with men I don't know - whether from my own campus or another (including at conferences). I actually won't talk to men I don't know in any academic setting. This severely curtailed my ability to build networks as I was in a male-dominated sub-field. I have subsequently shifted to a completely different subfield that tends to attract more women. I have left behind the very areas of study that brought me into the academy in the first place. I find it difficult to muster the same enthusiasm and dedication to this new area of study, but I can't handle being in conference sessions that are attended almost entirely by men. 

For several conferences or workshops after, I would lock myself in my room and order room service at the end of the day (and I sometimes still do - I travel with meals I can make in the barest of hotel rooms).  I run out of the last session, head down, and beeline to my room. On the rare occasion I have been talked into going to a social event, I have panic attacks or simply freeze, unable to hold a conversation. I'm fairly certain I have been flat-out rude to many senior faculty in my field out of absolute fear. 

Also, when I was on the job market and went out for dinner and drinks during interviews, I could barely hold it together if the group (or in one instance, the only person) was male. Considering the extreme pressure we are under during interviews, this certainly did not help.","I developed a fear of men for a while. I have become hyper aware of anything even resembling intoxication, flirtation, or even just plain old interest in my work (each of the times at conferences, the men had expressed interest in my work, as though what I was saying was actually worth listening to - something that rarely happens while in graduate school). I developed severe anxiety at conferences (particularly). I also hid it from my husband, which certainly did not help our relationship. I finally told him, five years later. 

And it certainly has not helped my overwhelming sense of imposter syndrome. As a woman of color, I already carried a heavy weight of ""She just got that [fill in the blank] because she's a WoC"" frequently. And the first few times people (besides my committee) showed a keen interest in my work, things turned ugly. 

The worst part has been the self-blame. The constant questioning, ""What should I have done?"" ""Did I lead him on?"" ""When is being friendly crossing a line?"" ""Was it my fault? Clearly, there is a pattern, so I MUST be doing something wrong."" And the guilt. ""I was drinking, it's not his fault, don't ruin his career, you should have known better."" ","When I started my current position, I was ""warned"" about one of the men in the department by two TT Fac - nothing specific, just generally to give him a wide berth. I avoided him for the first two years, barely able to string a full sentence together in front of him. Since then, he has turned out to be quite a wonderful colleague. I still have no idea what the ""warning"" was about, and I still put space between us at social events.  

I also won't argue theory with men anymore. I only just realized this recently in the middle of a conversation in which I said, ""Okay, I guess you're right,"" when the person (male) was clearly wrong.

One of my responsibilities was to meet and look after our guest speaker until it was time for her to introduce the competition. She is a well known CEO not just here - she was an early pioneer in social media and sold her company to a large media company for millions. As well as being a CEO and has a lot of money, she uses her new company as a way to talk about her good deeds in supporting women and female entrepreneurs.  It sounds like she's supporting good causes, but   having met her I see it's a key part of her ego.  We were in the lounge that's in the business school away from the main auditorium and class rooms - we were supposed to take a tour of the building, but she said she really needed a drink, so we had a good 45 minutes to kill.  She asked for a glass of wine, I was 20 at the time, so didn't really know much about wine. It was 5pm - but all we had was coffee and water.  We were talking about her company and the courses I was taking and what I planned to do.  She told me she was a big fan of young talent.  The conversation became more personal with her asking me how she looked - she looked like my mom who has a corporate job but I didn't think she'd like it if I said that to her.  She then asked me if I felt the ""boys"" in the audience would find her attractive - I said I didn't know.  She then asked me if I thought she was sexy. I knew from her bio how old she was and that she had a husband and a lot of kids from a previous marriage and a new one, so I didn't know what to say.  She sat down next to me and put her hand on my leg and said what about now.  She moved her hand up and grabbed me through my jeans.  She laughed and said something mean.  She then grabbed my hand and put it on her breast... she said I better be nice to her or she would tell my professor that I had touched her.  I could feel myself going bright red and I could feel puke in the back of my throat. Someone made a sound outside the lounge and she jumped up. She told me not to say anything and may be I would be lucky at the end of the evening.  She told me if I said anything she would get me kicked out and make it impossible for me to work in the city - my whole family lives here and so I was planning to stay.  I had told her this earlier.

12/19/2017 11:15:17,"I was glad I passed my thesis defense. But that was not the end. I was told to revise the thesis drastically to meet his unrealistically high expectation. After satisfying all committee members' request, I was held hostage working to improve my thesis, and delayed my graduation, my chance to get my work visa on time, and missed a job opportunity.

A year later, I published an extension of my thesis work with my then collaborators, without my advisor as a co-author. He didn't like the idea of this extended work when I presented it to him while I was his student. After knowing about this published work, he sent an accusation email to the editor-in-chief of that journal and IEEE's person who oversees academic misconduct, and accused me of plagiarism. The editors dismissed the accusation after their investigation. But this was not the end. He said he will keep investigating. 

I'm now working in a university. It took me 4 years to overcome the fear and self-doubt. I never asked him for recommendation letters, and never told him where I went. But he still follows me, finding my new email address and sent me emails, asking me to work for him. At one point I told him to stop contacting me. He then used one of my friend (who was also his student) to send me messages. 

I wasn't his only victim. He got suspended twice by the university due to various reasons. However, he manipulated some of his students. One of them sent us this:

""Dear All,

As you remember, Dr. X was suspended last year, and I sent a request to you all for your support to Dr. X... 

After that suspension was due, the university started an investigation, which was completed in August this year.  Unfortunately, Dr. X has been suspended again still without any pay or permission given to contact his students since August this year. They accused Dr. X of mistreating, bullying, or harassing students, which is untrue. 
......
At this moment, we also still need your support. Would you please update your letter you wrote last year, sign it and then send the scanned copy to me?""

I hope my case can give the community some encouragement that not all harassment cases are silent. The investigation was conducted by the university. They did something in hope for a change.

Focusing solely on sexual harassment that goes beyond more simple gender-based harassment (one example of many: calling me a secretary when my role was Scientific Writer), I will write about two independent incidences of physical sexual harassment/assault. The first, when I was in my first year as a graduate student, there was a more senior grad student in my program (he was a 3rd year student, if I recall correctly) who made it a habit to grab the asses of women graduate students. I was groped at least 3 times by him, once during class. Another woman graduate student in my program reported him, although I do not know the outcome of this. However, I do know that he went on, within the same organization, to become a postdoc, and is now a research assistant professor there. The second incident occurred when I was a postdoc at another institution. I was attending a Gordon Research Conference, which was held at a boarding school; the conference was very insular, and prettymuch no contact with the outside world for the week. I observed multiple instances of older, established male professors - leaders in the field - speaking and behaving inappropriately with woman trainees and early-career professors, mostly during the evening dinners/recreation. On the last night a dance was held, and I was dancing with a few of the other women. One of these field leaders (one of the organizers for the conference) grabbed me by the wrist, embraced me, and kissed me, all without my consent and with physical resistance (the music was really too loud for anything to be said and heard).

This suspicion probably negatively affects my career.","Collectively, sexual and gender-based harassment have affected my sense of safety, confidence in others' perception of my abilities - professional and otherwise - and vigilance & awareness moving through this world, and have caused me to be more careful in professional contexts, particularly when I am advising or counseling male trainees (I do career advising & counseling for postdocs now) - I specifically requested an office with a window to the hallway to make me feel safer and deter inappropriate actions on their part because, as the more senior person, I fear that I would be blamed in a professional context if something were to happen.

12/18/2017 8:56:20,"In December of 2015, the Chair of my department got angry at me for questioning a scheduling decision and told me that he would like me to ""lift my skirt."" He then proceeded to tell me how many times he ""has thoughts about me"" and had to ""stop himself from coming down to my office."" After I sent him an email asking him not to speak like that to me anymore, he sent me three emails (to my university as well as my private email address) and put a 2-page typed letter under my office door.  He admitted in those emails and the letter what he had said and did.  So, this was not a ""he said/she said"" -- it was a ""she said/he agreed.""  After the email and letter under my door, which very much made my skin crawl, I filled out a harassment complaint.","I was the Chair of my department until I took a different position as a Director at my university.  However, I still taught in my former department so, in effect, I had two supervisors, one of whom was the person who  harassed me.",The Chair of my department.,Small Liberal Arts College,redacted,Business,,"The university brought in an outside company to do an investigative report. The report concluded that I had been sexually harassed. My request was that the perpetrator's office be moved from my building, and that he be removed from being my immediate supervisor (in other words, I requested to report directly to the Dean), and that the perpetrator would be sent to sensitivity training.  I did not ask that he lose his position, nor at that time did I ask for any financial settlement.","As far as I know, he was not obligated to go to sensitivity training.  He was given a cryptic letter in his personnel file that said something to the effect that he had violated a conduct code.  The letter in his file did not mention sexual harassment; it simply gave a conduct code number.  He was not put on a performance improvement plan.  Indeed, he received a significant raise the following year. Our state is in a budget crisis, and there were supposedly no raises given that year campus-wide.","2016 was, bar none, the most difficult year of my professional (nearly 30-year) career at my university.  There were so many times I almost walked out the door on a successful and meaningful career. I was asked to teach more credits hours, which I felt violated the terms of my contract. My harasser would talk to his supervisors about me and send negative emails to my coworkers about me. My harasser's office was directly across the hall from the department bathroom, so for an entire year I walked up to the floor above to use the bathroom. Little things like looking down the hall prior to leaving my office became a daily habit. In October of 2016, my harasser (then still my supervisor) required me to attend a meeting that he called for himself, my Dean, the VPAA and me.  I was not told the intent of the meeting beforehand even though I asked.  I walked in ""cold."" At that meeting he asked that I ""be nice"" to him.  I walked out of the meeting.","I did seek counseling and was told that I was suffering from the trauma.  I couldn't sleep and dealt with anxiety for 1-1.5 hours every morning prior to building up my nerve to go to work.  I berated myself for not calling 9-1-1 the day of the incident.  Instead, I relied on my university to protect me.  I realize now, that was a big mistake. ","After a full calendar year, my harasser was told to move his office to another (adjacent) building and was asked to step down from the chair position.  He continues to be a full professor, tenured.  I am not sure what the reason was that he was physically moved or demoted a full year after he harassed me.  I certainly don't think it had anything to do with me--he was moved and demoted nearly a year after my harassment complaint. I still am very cognizant of my surroundings on campus.

12/17/2017 7:43:29,"I was a grad student at a small liberal arts university in Colorado. I studied Tibetan Language and Buddhist Studies and decided to do a language immersion in Tibet in the summer of 2006. I chose a program through UVA and Columbia that a few of my friends had done years prior. 
It was the summer the railroad was completed. The director of the program was an adjunct faculty member at Columbia. He and I had email contact prior to the program. I had thought I might not be able to raise enough money to go and his response to that fact via email was mean and shaming and I remember the email having the tone of “you are screwing everything up for everybody.” I felt horrible. And last minute, got the money, which was a few thousand dollars, I believe. So I could go.

When I got to Chengdu, I found out immediately that the Chinese government were not issuing student visas at all because of fears of protest related to the railroad opening. Everyone in the program knew this because there were emails about it. But I had not received any of those emails. I was kept out of the loop. So suddenly I was in Chengdu for who knows how long before we figured out how to get into Lhasa. I was kind of rapidly processing a very different program all at once. We also would not have access to the usual University professors the program generally worked with because of the same protest fears, etc. 

So we all tried to figure out what to do with our time and many of us decided to travel to Eastern Tibet by car. The director of the program offered to let us all keep our bags in his room as we traveled. A kind gesture that I think we all took him up on.

I went one morning, I think the morning we were heading out. I had wanted to be on better terms with him as the only contact I really had to that point were the mean emails. So we sat in his room about 10 minutes and talked. I told him about my studies, about a non profit I worked for, about this and that. 

I got up to leave and he opened his arms to hug which did not bother me. I was happy we were on more congenial terms and I am a hugger. So this was normal to me. I hugged him and in a split second he pulled me tightly, put his hand on my ass, his tongue in my ear. I hardly had the time to take in what was happening but it was happening so fast. I pushed him from me and he pulled me back this time his tongue trying for my mouth. I pushed again and mustered a “no.”

And something that I always remember so vividly was saying as I walked toward the door was, “thanks for letting me store my bag” as I left. This reflex to remain polite and to pacify in spite of the fact that I felt disoriented and creeped out. And I remember how my mind was working fast. He was the leader of the program, the only authority of the situation. I didn’t know what I needed from him exactly but I knew I relied on him for plenty of things. 

I went to the street and used a payphone to call my then boyfriend/now husband to cry. It was a tremendously groundless and strange feeling. And the director was utterly oblivious. He ended up being the only teacher for the program, so I had to theoretically learn Tibetan from him everyday for weeks from that point onward, which proved to be impossible.

12/16/2017 17:02:25,,,,,,,,,,,,,"I already submitted an event, but I have a side comment I forgot to add:
I was a TA for a number of semesters for a very senior professor (senior in that he’d been editor of our Discipline’s journal for years when he was younger and senior in that he was the oldest faculty member on campus (the last WWII vet still teaching)). I would carry the exams and student papers to and from class. I thought nothing of it, as I did this for all classes I was a TA for – since I took them all home and graded them afterall! But, every time he would repeatedly tell me what a shame it was for him and how wrong it was – a 20something female apparently should not carry 100 multiple choice exams – but, he was too old now and simply could not carry them. But, he consistently made sure that I knew that he thought it was wrong, and that he never let his female TAs carry anything until very recently (he could no longer walk very well). 
 I do have a side note: I’d like to suggest that you initiate a similar type of survey at some point about racist comments and acts in the academy. I suspect that might be even more horrifying than this survey. 
For instance: I thought little of this man’s gendered comments (other than how old was), because he was so racist. In his lectures in class he would use racist terms!—he used the words “wetbacks” “spics,” he’d tell students “Eskimos, or as they now decided they want to be called: Inuit” etc etc etc throughout the semester. This wasn’t limited to his lectures, for instance after leaving his class one day I ran into a friend of mine who said: “Is Professor ____ deaf!?” No, I just spoke to him 5 minutes ago for like 10 minutes. Okay, that’s what I thought – I was just in the elevator with him and I said “Hello Professor ___[his last name]” FOUR times. He never even looked at me. This friend was a senior grad student who had been in the department much much longer than me – which is to say the professor knew he was a student in our department. But, as this student was originally from Puerto Rico, the professor did not feel the need to even look up or acknowledge his existence or greeting. 
I know that you’re busy this this very important survey, but one on racism in the academy would be useful and some point, and deeply troubling. and of course often intertwined with this one:
Another elevator example: my good friend was in a different department, hers is on the 12th - 14th floor of the building next to mine. She had to resort to taking the stairs up, because she kept encountering a male professor from another department in the elevator, and things got scary for her – he’d block her when she would try to get out of the elevator, for example, and demand she answer his strange racist-sexist questions. At first, he’d keep asking her where she was from. She would tell him something, her answer was clearly not what he was looking for. He’d keep pestering her, all the way up the elevator (he was in a different department, a floor or two below hers). Eventually whenever he saw her he’d just say something like “ching chong ching” (etc) repeatedly. (the context is that she is Asian-American, but her surname does not reflect that as she was adopted). He didn’t need to know any of that. But, every time she saw him he'd harass her. She complained to her advisers and they said there was nothing she could do and she should not report it.  Not only did she have to resort to walking up the 14 flights of narrow dark stairs, he’d harass her other places. We often wrote in the library, and sometimes she’d see him in there, coming or going, and he’d do the same thing! – look at her and say that shit. 
It made her so mad, in part because it was SO common. She repeatedly told me this is just what some old white men think they get to do to Asian American women. This man harassed her so much she didn’t even want to come to campus or go to the library. She told her Department Chair, her Dept’s Director of Graduate Studies, and other professors who were supposed to do something, and they all told her there wasn't much she could do and advised her against pursuing anything. Basically, framing it as it’d mess up her career, not his if she reported on the big-shot old professor in another Department. We only knew his name from that department’s website.  These type of normalized racist-sexist comments are why people stop even bothering to report things. 
SO, THANK YOU FOR THIS SURVEY!

12/16/2017 16:19:34,"The chair of the department where I was a graduate student used to rub the female grad students; we all thought it was odd, but just how it was. For example, our department designated a few grad students each semester to be “Grad Representatives” at the Faculty meetings (we were to take notes, send these along to our grad student collages and be the official voice that would represent the grad student concerns and opinions to the faculty in the faculty meetings). When I was a grad rep, this man would sit next to me and rub my thigh the whole meeting (I didn’t sit at the conference table as it could only seat some of the faculty, the rest sat in chairs around the room, and I sat in one of these chairs as well – which is to say his behavior was not under a table, or anything, but out in the open among his colleages and my professors). He did this to the other grad rep (also a female grad student) as well when she attended meetings, and to the grad reps other semesters too. I now realize that we were in a room with more than 20 faculty in a top R1 department, and no one ever ever commented on it, even in private. It is true that our department had (and still has) very few women faculty (at the time maybe 10% of faculty were women; there were more women than men grad students, however). The behavior of this chair was treated as sort of a running joke in the department. One time when a few of us were discussing him, another friend of mine said “your thigh!? -- Every time I see him he rubs my stomach/torso.” He’d rub and pet her in the hallway, whenever he saw her, not just at meetings/ sitting down. Everyone saw these things, and NO one thought to comment -- other than among ourselves.

I think that part of the reason no one thought much of it and certainly no one thought to report it was because this seemed minor compared to some of his other behaviors that didn’t involve active grad students.  He had a what all grad students parsed to me and my cohort on arrival as 30+ year affair with a woman who then taught (not TT) in our department – the two of them shared one office (meant for 1 faculty member, same size as every other faculty office). She had started as an undergrad and continued through her PhD in the department, he had been her adviser. Moreover, the two of them ran a seminar for first year graduate students in which he would consistently engage in strange banter with her, which would inevitably result in her saying “Students! [his name]!” He was married with children, and that family was the focus of every talk he gave in our department. And now, the room where our department events and Lectures are held is named after him (on all events, flyers, etc, the room number isn’t given, rather just his name). 
",grad student,Chair of the department,Other R1,,Social Sciences,,none that I've ever known of,none that I've ever known of,none,"These events were so thoroughly normalized (happening in front of all faculty, and yet never ever commented upon) that the behavior was made to seem acceptable, just a bit eccentric. 
I didn’t realize how odd it was until just this fall: when I was at a conference, a friend and I were talking to some relative big shit guy (quite a bit older than me, not an academic), he kept putting his arm around me – which I only noticed because my friend (who is a male grad student) was like what the hell is that about, why does he keep grabbing you and wrapping his arms around you? And I was told him “oh, he does?--probably because he’s an old guy, and that’s what they do"" basically, I don’t even notice anymore. My friend was shocked. And my naturalized response is pretty f***ed up, I realized!  But, in a context where any reaction AT ALL is framed as “over-reacting” how are we supposed to get through daily life in a world where any of the people we have to talk to and interact with to survive are men substantially older than ourselves, who present this type of touch as ""friendly"" or ""fatherly""?   The horror of my friend (the male grad student, from a different department at the same R1 I’d attended) at this situation is what made me realize the extent of how much we naturalize these things. 
","see above, unfortunately: Thoroughly normalized. But, my friend’s shock also made me realize that despite his radical scholar credentials and political commitments, this aspect of his male privilege was invisible to him, and suddenly visible to me. He wasn’t accustomed to this -- he didn’t get hugged and petted by any older guy in a position of relative power that so pleased, and didn’t realize that this is the case for many of his female colleagues.

12/16/2017 15:18:59,"A fellow PhD student in my department has a history of routinely making weird sexually charged comments to other students (women), especially when he doesn't have a girlfriend.  Many of them are weirdly intrusive implied questions about their partners or sex lives.  My least favorite of his comments at least partially directed at me came during our first semester of graduate school when he sat between me and another then-first-year PhD student, a woman, in the back of a large van on the way to a site for a class field trip.  He and the other PhD student were discussing the efficacy of the flu vaccine, which I found annoying, so I mostly was trying to ignore them.  Then the conversation shifted to other vaccines, and more people got involved, including master's students sitting in front of us.  Eventually the HPV vaccine came up, and he said something along the lines of, ""Well, you only need that if you're sexually active, and I'm sure none of the ladies in this van would do anything like that.""  We all just sort of shut up and stared at him; the master's student directly in front of him (Indian Canadian) just shook her head once at him in disgust at his behavior.  I think he knew by then that the PhD student sitting on his other side lived with her boyfriend, and a lot of his own behavior made it clear that he was no sexual neophyte, so it's not like he genuinely believed what he had said and thought he was complimenting our purity.  He knew he was making us uncomfortable; I'm not sure if he actually thought anyone would take the bait and start spilling our sexual histories or if just making us uncomfortable was all he meant to achieve.  Of course we were stuck in the van with him for awhile longer; I squished harder to the side and went back to staring out the window.  Sometime soon after, I made some passing comment about how creepy he was to my older labmates, both women, and they pulled me into their office, shut the door, and went off with their own stories about him and what they'd heard from other people.  We considered asking our advisor to talk to the student, knowing that our male advisor considered himself a feminist, and that this student respected our advisor and needed him on his committee.  I decided I would try to confront him myself first.  I ended up doing it really softly; in an email about something else class-related I concluded by asking that he refrain from making sexual comments, because it made me uncomfortable.  He did stop around me, and for awhile, I thought I had done something.  I have since heard ongoing rumors of continued such behavior and worse, particularly when he is a TA helping lead overnight field trips of mostly master's students, and everyone shares a house and drinks; I've heard of him taking a woman's phone and texting her boyfriend , ongoing gross mouthing off, and other dumb but really not OK stuff.  As a first-year, I had thought that he was a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen, and that his bad behavior needed to be shut down then in part for his own good, before he got into real trouble, but now, as a somewhat more jaded fifth-year, I wonder if he'll just keep getting away with it, and get worse, but perhaps better at knowing what he needs to hide, as he continues to progress up the ranks.  Science-wise, there's no reason he won't progress.  I almost feel a little irresponsible for having confronted him myself about his behavior towards me and stopping it that way, instead of reporting him to an authority figure, because now I don't have solid grounds to do anything to stop him from becoming the sort of deeply embedded predator that frightens women away from our field and worse.",PhD student,PhD student (equal),Elite Institution/Ivy League,Duke University,Environment,,"Didn't report, myself.  If anyone else has, I am not aware of any responses.","None apparent; he's doing great, and the professors all seem to support him.","By itself, none.  Overall, trauma-induced mental and physical health issues, relating in part to someone else's sexual violence that this student's behavior and similar reinforced as reason not to trust men or believe that society and its institutions had my best interests at heart, did lead to long stretches of very low productivity in grad school, and I've probably produced less work, some of which is less thorough and of lower quality, and failed to approach people or go after opportunities, than I might have otherwise.  It's hard to say what could have been, though, and again, I don't think this one guy's behavior had much to do with it.  ","I already had anxiety and depression; I do remember worrying about what this guy was up to and how to deal with him even when he wasn't around, so he probably aggravated it some.  That comment he made about female sexuality did not help with my own mixed feelings about my own morality and self-worth, which came from being in what I now recognize as a sexually abusive relationship at the time.  This student's persistence now, in terms of probably continuing to harass other women and definitely continuing in my school as a successful scientist, leads to a bit of bitter pessimism that probably does the same, though less so.  I had a lot of other issues, so he was relatively not that bad.","By itself, none.  This kind of thing, and on top of it, the cluelessness of professors (almost all straight white men) and most administrators in my school at the toll taken on people who aren't like them by the normalcy and our consistent problems with harassment and assault, has collectively gotten to me, though.  In the past year or two, I've really started to doubt that I will ever be able to focus on research enough to make it as a scientist, in part because I'm so distracted by all the ways the institutions that make science are screwed up.  For all the administrators and professors talk about wanting to increase diversity, they don't seem to like it much when I and other students do things that might actually help increase it, or complain or point out problems; they seem to prefer that we shut up and focus on research.  I know that my job right now is to finish my dissertation, that everyone has to really focus in the homestretch, but I feel like more and more of who I am is not acceptable to bring to work, lately including the increasingly pissed-off-feminist with zero tolerance for harassment.  This sense that who I am and what I care about is not really welcome has me resolutely opposed to further work in an environment anything like where I work now, and struggling to figure out if there's a kind of job still within my general field that would make use of my education and satisfy my brain, but also let me do what I think is valuable, including to care about my colleagues.","As I alluded previously, part of why this situation seems so minor is that I've also been in a relationship that basically began with sexual abuse, with a then-fairly-distant-coworker at a research station.  I had become dependent on him emotionally as a friend during a difficult time, and when he pushed things physically, I was really uncomfortable, but couldn't decide what to do, so I mostly just let him have his way.  I felt like it was all my fault and really blamed and hated myself, and tried to tell myself I was just being a prude, but it was bad; I'm reasonably sure that at least one each of the incidents would technically count as sexual assault and rape, and much of it was sexual coercion. I ended up with what it took years to acknowledge as clear PTSD, on top of Complex PTSD from an emotionally abusive childhood, which I read makes one vulnerable to ""re-victimization;"" see above.  Insofar as I'm not sure if the research station counts as academia per se, and most of the worst of what happened (besides that first sexual assault) occurred after his job there ended and we were traveling together elsewhere, plus it's all rather complicated because I thought of him as a friend more than a coworker (met him at a work dinner; only actually saw him while working once), I didn't include this story as an answer to the main survey; I figured it's probably not what you're after.  It does have professional consequences now; we still work in broadly the same field.  After having seen him at a work conference a year and a half ago, mentally faced what happened with him a few months later, and wrung a promise out of him over email that he would never do anything like that to anyone else, even though I don't think he's actually a threat to me now, I just really never want to see him again.  As a result, I decline invitations to visit the school where he now works, even though it would probably professionally benefit me to go, and am going to hesitate to go to conferences where he is also listed as a presenter in future.",Male,43085638179,yes,Male,Environment,Environment,Phd Student,Phd,Elite Institution/Ivy League,Duke ,633,Duke,Environment
12/16/2017 15:06:58,"I was in a slightly conservative English department. I was very engaged but having trouble finding people to work with. The two women most likely to supervise my work were obviously having their own struggles: one had a four year old and complained to me that she couldn't get away for conferences. She saw me as a sympathetic ear when I went to a Kathy Acker conference, rather than someone she would want to champion. The other, though established, obviously didnt get institutional respect and was not terribly active nor current. Mid-MA, a new hire came back to his hometown where I was studying. I was stunned how much the work he was doing around class and urbanism overlapped with the digressive research I had begun during a seminar paper on Ulysses. I found out he founded the poetry collective which was the primary draw to me studying in this region. I was a bit overwhelmed by all of this consonance. It seemed mutual (I thought, lol) and we began to work together. It was all independent because for some reason he wasn't teaching graduate classes right away. During this time I began to write about art. Of course, coincidentally, he wrote about art too. I began seeing him around at art functions & got a variously flirty and disparaging vibe. I thought he was a wonderful candidate for friend-supervisor-contermporary. His relationship to academia and being a prof was obviously troubled (by his working class roots/Marxism?). There was obviously some mutual magnetism, but what began to happen is this: He began to check out my chest during meetings. He neglected to pay any attention to my work or progress. He seemed really struck when I changed my hair from curly to straight. I finally got him into a meeting about my work and he asked if I had taken my ideas from an architect we mutually knew. He eventually titled an essay loosely based on the concept/metaphor I had created (the one he thought I was fed by the architect). I thought it was my fault for slightly crushing on him. But I have to wonder: WHAT MALE GRAD STUDENT DOESNT BRING HIS BASIC DRIVE INTO HIT GRADUATE WORK? And what male supervisor who decides to champion him isn't in some ways responding to that? I decide to write about art ""instead"" of pursuing academia. I see this person at conferences still (I am still academic adjacent though my writing and I adjunct). The vibe is just as weird. Never respect. Never inquiry about my work. He is friend with my friends but doesn't see me as worthy?

12/16/2017 0:48:14,"For the duration of my doctoral program, my advisor crossed professional boundaries, culminating in her telling me I was mentally ill and that she worried I would off myself like so many other talented young women she'd known. She subtly (and not-so-subtly) made negative comments about other women in our field whose work I enjoyed or admired; she always had a story about how this one was a bitch or she'd heard that one say a weird thing once. A fellow doctoral student once told me privately that she'd behaved in a way that made the student worry she was hitting on him (both prof and student were each married), but I felt alarmed and uncomfortable and brushed it off, saying I was sure she didn't mean it that way (I wasn't sure, and I am so sorry I didn't hear him out. He could have been trying to tell me something worse). I never saw her as a mentor, but I had no other choiceto chair my dissertation committee--she was the only full-time faculty in my field. We were generally cordial with one another. In the final year of my degree, she amped up the abuse cycle of intense negging (about me, my work) and intense praise, sometimes delivering both in the same day. She told a fellow grad student that she feared running into me (her graduating advisee!) because things were ""so weird between us."" I became anxious even to check my email, fearing what new epic screed I might find from her. And finally, weeks before I was set to defend my dissertation, I opened one where she claimed that she feared for my mental health because she believed I was in the grip of a psychotic break and, further, I was in no position to be a member of any faculty (I was on the job market.... as was she). I still feel sick thinking about how that message might have been received by someone who was severely depressed or suicidal. When I forwarded the message to the dept chair and our graduate advisors, the chair made a comment that made it clear my advisor had been bad-mouthing me and painting me as unhinged or untrustworthy. I realized her email wasn't the product of a bad day/semester/stress on the job but the culmination of her interfering with my progress towards my degree in the months before I was set to complete it.

Though other tenured professors in my discipline with whom I had a good relationship were aware of the incident (through their role as advisors), not one offered a word of support or even acknowledgement of what had happened. The tone of the departmental response was ""Look, we all know she's a pill, do you really need to bitch about it? We've got enough on our plate.""

Before I cut ties with her, I had stopped including her rec in my dossier for job apps. After I cut ties, she withdrew my rec, so I'll never know if she had said something negative, demeaning, or backhanded about me in it.

12/15/2017 23:56:01,"I literally just saw his obituary on facebook. This isn't even my story to tell, but seeing his face - and reading the comments of all of these people who think he was so great - I am just so angry. So here is the story that isn't mine: My closest friend, another woman sociologist who is a gender scholar, was recruited by a top gender scholar (male) in his 70s (she was in her early 30s and untenured) to meet with him to discuss whether or not she wanted to co-author a textbook with him at a conference. She was exited about the meeting - which happened at the ASA conference - but I got a panicked text from her a few hours later asking me to come meet her in the lobby of our hotel because he was trying to convince her to come to his hotel room to sleep with him. I joined, along with a woman who is a well-respected senior scholar, and the four of us had drinks and chatted for 30-40 minutes and I was shocked and sickened to notice that this guy didn't back of for even a minute. He was continuously trying to touch my friend's leg, and began stroking her arm at one point (she seemed absolutely frozen), and didn't seem the least bit concerned the this actions were inappropriate. He was married but told my friend the marriage was loveless and that he could ""be in love with"" my friend, and would she give him a chance. It was disgusting. It was also clear to me that he had offered her a co-editorship on this textbook and was dangling it in front of my friend while simultaneously begging her to spend the night with him. My friend grew up in a fairly working-class family and has always struggled with imposter syndrome and the fear that she won't make it as a scholar.... she was the perfect victim for this type of disgusting manipulation. So it was the 4 of us having drinks in a hotel lobby, and my goal, in coordination with the woman senior scholar who was with me, was to stay at the table until this man gave up and went to bed. It never fucking happened. Eventually it was last call, and I saw my friend's face, knew she was panicking (to be clear, in her world it would have been impossible to assertively tell him to back off), so we all rode up the elevator together to make sure he didn't get off at her floor. He, of course, didn't hit the button for his own floor, so the senior woman asked ""what is your floor?"" and hit the button FOR him, and said ""Goodnight! It was great spending time with you!"" and more or less pushed him out of the door. My friend was horrified and humiliated. She vacillated between wanting to report him to, well, anybody (in fact there is no clear place to report misconduct of this sort), and wanting to email him to apologize for not sleeping with him. She never did get that co-authorship on the textbook. TODAY I found out that he died a few days ago. I found out because some of his former students posted his obituary on facebook, saying so many nice things about him. It made me furious. I wanted to post something on facebook, telling these women - many who are absolutely amazing feminist gender scholars - that this man they thought of with kind memories was a creepy shameless predator who has to this day made my friend wonder if he was ever interested in her for her work, and if, maybe, somehow, there was a way she could have handled things to avoid the harassment but still be given the opportunity to co-author. I'm furious. I'm glad he's dead. I just wish this was MY story to tell instead of my friend's, so I could take him down and destroy his memory. But, then again, he never would have chosen me to harass in this way because he chose his victims carefully, and my friend was incredibly vulnerable. Like I said, I'm glad he's dead.","I was a graduate student, as was my friend. We were both on the job market. ","He was a senior scholar in his field.

12/15/2017 23:10:00,"Upon arrival for summer fieldwork in a foreign country, my graduate advisor insisted that we share a hotel room with a single bed, and spent the night attempting (without success) to get me to declare my love for him and to sleep together (I insisted on sleeping alone on the floor).  His inappropriate comments, touching, asking me to ""at least"" give him a piece of my unwashed laundry to sleep with, etc. continued, despite my firm refusals, for the remaining weeks of the project, and all I clung to was the hope that the relationship would become purely professional again when we returned from the field (and to our respective fiances).  Things did seem better back home during the fall semester, but in the winter he and his fiance broke up, and the inappropriate emails and invitations resumed.  He even began forwarding me email conversations between himself and an undergraduate who he had insisted on taking on dates after she had come to his office asking for a letter of recommendation (he had spelled out all the details in the emails).  I can only imagine that he was trying to show me the kind of grand romance that ""I was missing out on,"" or something yucky of the sort.  Ultimately, my refusals to meet privately with him escalated to him threatening to give me a bad annual review and have me thrown out of the program.  I next went to the (then) department chair, director of graduate studies, and a female professor, to ask for help, and was repeatedly turned away.  I finally reported him to the Title IX office, and things only got worse from there.  I turned over all of the emails and a list of willing witnesses, and the ""investigation"" dragged on for almost a year (during which I was forbidden to speak about it, but continued to be slandered within the department) before the Title IX office issued a report stating that some of his ill-advised behaviors ""may have led [me] to feel that [I] was being harassed,"" but they concluded that I actually was not.  The report was also worded in such a way that it painted me in a very negative light.",Ph.D. Student,"Assistant Professor, my primary advisor",Other R1,University of Minnesota,Anthropology,,Retaliation for reporting.  ,"A couple of years later, he was denied tenure (he appealed, claiming that it was due to my ""false"" accusations, and they concluded that it was for unrelated reasons).  He left the department and was given a position advising undergraduates.  This didn't last more than a year or two and then he quietly left the institution.","The Title IX report was circulated within the department and I was pegged as a liar and a troublemaker.  I was kicked off a book project (for which I had been co-editor of a previous edition), and most of the faculty on my graduate committee emailed to state that they were no longer willing to serve on my committee.  I persisted in completing my research, with assistance from mentors in other departments and at other institutions.  I did manage to graduate, but it took several additional years to acquire a new advisor and committee.  I am very thankful for those who ultimately did come through for me.  When on the job market, several faculty declined (or outright ignored) my requests for letters of recommendation, despite having earned a 4.0, and excellent comments, in every one of their classes.  I landed a tenure-track position, anyway, with recommendations from other successful colleagues.","I experienced periods of deep depression and despair, as well as feelings of inadequacy and shame.  At times, I still struggle with ""impostor syndrome.""","I have managed to stay on track toward my goals; however, it took approximately five years longer to graduate and land a tenure-track position, than it likely would have if my original advisor had remained professional and supportive, if I'd had positive access to the full network of my professors' peers, and if all the faculty who knew my work best would have been willing to recommend me.

12/15/2017 19:38:22,"A few years ago I was introduced to a senior academic, twenty years older than myself, in an interdisciplinary field closely allied with my own. My four-year contract at the R1 university in town had just ended with no prospect of renewal and no hope of being turned into a permanent position. I was a single mother of a toddler about to go on Employment Insurance. The senior academic works at a nearby university and is the head of an important research institute. He is very well-connected and is well-known for helping young academics in their careers. A mutual friend connected us through email and the senior academic looked up my web site at the university and read about my work, quickly inviting me to an academic party at his house. When I met him he was very interested in my work and asked to see my latest project. After reading my work he admitted, somewhat grudgingly, that I was a good writer and didn't need his help with the article. He asked if I would submit it to a journal he is affiliated with. I did so and the paper went out for review. Shortly thereafter he invited me over to talk about the paper, which I thought was odd as it had already gone through the submission process and was under review. He asked me to dinner at his house, where he expected me to do some of the cooking because he didn't know how. After dinner he asked me, quite openly and with no innuendo, whether I would enter into a sexual relationship with him in exchange for career mentoring. I was horrified but merely said I was not ready to enter another relationship so soon after my divorce (which was true). Although my paper, which had already gone out for double blind review, was published, I understand that he now gives very mediocre reviews when asked about my work. He has asked me out on more than one occasion since that time and appears to keep tabs on my status. I recently had to ask a friend to pose as my boyfriend at academic events that the senior academic is likely to be at. After the first such time the senior academic questioned me very closely about the nature of my ""relationship"" and whether it was serious and whether my ""boyfriend"" was local and what he did and so on. He hasn't bothered me since that time, but I no longer get invites to academic events at his research institution, and thus an important networking opportunity is lost to me - although given the way he has sabotaged my connections since I turned him down, perhaps this isn't a bad thing.",Adjunct Lecturer,Internationally recognized scholar and chair of local research institute,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")",,,,"I have since discovered that this scholar's targeting of junior female colleagues is an open secret in most of the institutions he has been affiliated with, but nothing has ever been done.",None,"Since I turned him down, the harasser has spoken poorly of my abilities to other local scholars, and I am no longer invited to academic events I formerly took part in.

12/15/2017 18:23:14,"	I was star-struck by this Distinguished Professor and readily accepted his offers to help me get into grad school. When he subsequently began to flirt with me, I was beyond flattered. His charisma blinded me to the power imbalances that made the notion of consent between us problematic. This imbalance only intensified once I followed him to his department and became his advisee. He knew that he was the only faculty who had overlapping interests with mine, and that I based my decision upon my understanding that our relationship would become more professional by necessity. He only stood by this promise for two weeks before requesting oral sex (that surprised me by being unreciprocated). A few days later he notified me that he had had a change of heart and that our relationship would need to become strictly professional. He listed a number of reasons behind this decision, such as the negative consequences that would befall me if anyone were to find out. Lurking behind these seemingly concerned words was a clear threat: he would continue a professional and supportive relationship with me IF I KEPT QUIET. This threat was obscured by his insistence that I had power too, that if his family found out they would leave him. I didn’t realize he was my abuser, my captor, until a year and a half later, when I called a crisis hotline to get help with my self-diagnosed Stockholm Syndrome.
	This happened two weeks into my PhD program. He continued to function as my teacher and my mentor, but he withdrew the warmth that I had come to depend on, within an otherwise hostile department. I was worried that he would lose professional interest in me now that sex was off the table. I obsessed over ways to get that warmth back, to rekindle his interest in me. I spent copious amounts of my mental energy on my appearance on days that I would see him, reasoning that it was in my professional interest if he thought I was pretty. I found myself in uncharted emotional territories that consumed me for years. He is still my adviser.
","PhD student, advisee",Adviser and professor,Other R1,,Sociology,,"I finally began to tell trusted individuals at the end of that semester, when I felt like I was headed towards a nervous breakdown. However, I framed these disclosures as though I had been a consenting party. The following year, I began to realize how misleading that framework truly was, given our power imbalance, not to mention our age difference. I realized that he should have known better and probably did know better, but chose to enact his sexual fantasies through me despite the harm it would do to me. I was not a person to him. 
	A year and a half into this turmoil, I confided in a feminist studies mentor, without revealing his name. She suggested I confide in a colleague of hers within my department, who she thought might serve as a valuable ally for me. I followed this advice, again refusing to disclose the name of my abuser. I gave her a quick summary of what had happened, this time framing myself as a victim. She was visibly shocked and beseeched me to report it to the Title IX office. I explained that I was too afraid of the damage it would do to my career if I came forward; besides, I still cared about this person despite their abuse of me. 
The next day, I received an email from this professor, telling me that she wished I hadn’t told her if I was not prepared to report it. She had conferred with a mentor of hers who agreed that the burden I had placed upon her was unfair. She concluded by informing me that at her mentor’s behest, she had reported the incident to the Title IX office on our campus. When I read this email, my entire career flashed before my eyes. The secret and safety I had worked so hard to preserve disappeared in an instant. When I panicked in a response, she assured me that she did not provide my name nor the name of the professor who she suspected. Minimally reassured, I was left grappling with the betrayal that I felt at the hands of this so-called ally. I replied at length, explaining how severely she had violated my trust and disregarded my very real concerns about my safety and in response, she withdrew her agreement to serve on my dissertation committee. 
I shared this episode with my feminist studies professor later that night, so she would not send students like me to this person in the future. Instead of apologizing or sympathizing, she insisted that her colleague’s decision to withdraw from my committee could have been due to any number of reasons. Without skipping a beat, she added that she did not want to have any further conversations with me about the matter.
A few months later, I turned to the Graduate Student Director for professional guidance, with no intentions of repeating my mistake of disclosing this matter. She informed me that her biggest concern about me had to do with my personality. She went on to tell me that I had alienated everyone in my department throughout my time there. Struggling to hold back tears, I acknowledged that I had a lot of personal problems to work through and that I was seeing a therapist. As an impulse, I added that I had experienced sexual misconduct within the department when I first arrived, and that I relive that trauma every time I am on campus. Her face blanched, but she did not ask for details and she never followed up with me about the matter. To this day, we both pretend I never said anything.
",none,"I learned a painful lesson that semester: if I was not prepared to sacrifice my career, as well as this man’s reputation, I was a “bad victim” who did not deserve emotional or professional support. I remain shell-shocked by the hypocrisy of these so-called feminists and allies, who would turn their backs on me when I reached out in pain and fear. Their decision to revoke their support of me left me dependent upon my abuser, as the only mentor I had left. Of course, this only intensified my anxiety about regaining his affection and contingent attention. ","social alienation in my department, anxiety, Stockholm syndrome","I looked into switching schools, but I would have lost too much time. So I stayed put and minimized my involvement with my department. This has resulted in weaker ties to important people who might have helped me professionally","If this is how faculty respond when graduate students come forward about episodes of sexual misconduct, then there must be scores of unreported cases lurking within graduate studies departments throughout the country. There are so many reasons we remain silent. I could not afford to lose my only professional mentor. I could not afford to start over at a different school. But perhaps most significantly, I could not justify destroying this man’s legacy, which is all about advancing gender equality If I outed him, he would be exposed as a hypocrite. This is an additional consideration that students in other disciplines like STEM do not have to deal with, when they struggle with the decision to come forth. Only antifeminists would want to believe me—all of my potential mentors and colleagues within Gender Studies would struggle, and perhaps refuse, to believe me. It’s too hard to lose such a hero.
	I do not know what the solution is, to this problem. But I am not shocked by any of the recent headlines about progressive celebrities’ sexual misconduct. Sexual predation heeds no boundaries, be it political or departmental. None of us are safe. However, faculty allies and the academy as a whole could help us victims feel a lot safer. For example, perhaps faculty could prioritize a victim’s safety over their own comfort and sense of righteousness.  Perhaps the academic system could allow students who have experienced such abuse to transfer without further penalizing them by making them start from scratch. The academic system, as it is currently structured, traps students such as myself in unhealthy situations wherein we remain dependent upon our abusers. The academic system as a whole keeps us silent, while bloated giants sleep easy.

12/14/2017 10:01:00,"This is gender harassment, not sexual harassment, but it speaks to the climate that does not take women seriously as professional and intellectual persons.

When I arrived on my liberal arts campus over twenty years ago, I was one of the very first tenure-track professors to work on gender and sexuality. My own department has always been extremely supportive (after all, they chose me out of a pool of more than 400 candidates!). But I was surprised, having taught at other institutions, how cold other faculty were to me, and how few students I had. At the end of my first year, the conservative student newspaper published an expose of my department--gasp! all FIVE of us were registered democrats and could we be trusted?--but there was also a little satire about the problems my department had hiring, including a satire of me (unnamed) that I had done my dissertation on menstruation and what sort of evidence could possibly exist for that? (I did not do my dissertation on menstruation by the way, but reproduction.) I was confused, upset, and went to my dept. chair. He knocked on the other colleagues doors and said ""it's time to let her know what has happened."" We all met and the chair grabbed a big, giant file and said if I wanted to see it I could. 

Apparently a year earlier--when I gave my job talk--faculty in another department found my work so threatening (!) that they went to trustees and some number of them (I've never looked at the file) went to the president to try to get my job offer rescinded or buy out my three-year contract. The dean at the time was intertwined in all of this, and suddenly my inability the year before to get a contract out of him for months made sense. It also made sense how on the phone he told me things like ""I'm not sure we'll find an office for you; I'm not sure whether we can provide moving expenses."" There was no campus housing available for me (I was moving across the country)--I am the only faculty member in all these years who was not offered campus housing as far as I know. It made sense why I was paid in the high 30s, and how my salary remained in the 50s well into the 2000s. 

The thing was this story never seemed to go away. The story that the student paper had run about me got picked up in national conservative sources, including a college guide (that used the satirical material)--three years later, the director of PR got up at a faculty meeting boasting about how fantastic it was that our campus had such a great write up. For years, students would come tell me how their professors in another department joked about me and students would tell me how there was a joke that as I was doing book revisions, maybe they should put used tampons on my door for my research, etc. 

Despite the fact that my book and articles have ended up winning prizes, that I have earned all sorts of professional accomplishments outside my field, etc. I remain marginalized on my campus. I do get along with my colleagues--including some of the ones who were most hostile to me when I have arrived--and so I believe I am respected as a congenial, easy-going, hard-working colleague and I am a very popular professor among students, but my work on gender, sexuality, etc. is itself dismissed and not of interest to the academic community here. This is not sexual harassment, but it is part of a larger institutional problem where anything that has to do with gender, sexuality, and power is not considered as important as other fields and topics.

12/14/2017 9:37:54,"It was the summer before the second year of my MA. I had come home from my graduate institution, and I was in touch with my favorite professor from undergraduate. He had just retired, and he told me that he was getting rid of a lot of his books, so he was sort of holding a giveaway event at his house. A lot of these books were materials I would need on my upcoming master's exam, so I was eager to get what I could so that I didn't have to dip into my stipend to pay for these materials or lug them to and from the library. I was under the impression that other former students of his would be coming in and out of his house that day as well. 

When I went over, I was the only one there. Fine, maybe I was just in an off period and missed the other students coming. He made me some tea, and we spent a little bit of time catching up before we went back to his library to sort through some books. I had my reading list with me, and I took what I needed. Finally, when I was done, I wanted to start loading up the books in my car so that I could go home - I was living with my parents for the summer, and I was eager to get home so that I could make dinner.

That's when things got weird. The professor didn't want me to leave his house; he tried to get me to sit longer with him, he tried to put me in a reclining armchair and lay it all the way back. When I protested and told him that I needed to go home because traffic would get bad and my parents were expecting me, he replied, ""What? You want to get home so that you can hang out with your MOMMY?"" He was 70 and I was 25. He was old enough to be my grandpa. His face contorted and got ugly, and he grabbed my arm and tried to hold me down. 

I'm not entirely sure how I got out. Nothing aside from that happened, but the adrenaline kicked in - I knew that if I didn't get out of that house now, I was probably going to be raped. I don't remember what I said, but it was enough for him to let me out of the house. 

I also left with the books. I did use some of them on the exam, but most I haven't touched. They're still sitting in my garage because I can't look at them without immediately being sent back to that armchair, eyes wide, fearing what was going to happen next. This was a professor who used to be my favorite, who was my undergrad thesis advisor, who had been a recommender of mine, who I had kept in touch with all those years as a mentor, but nothing more. 

He did email me after this and asked me out, but in my response I lied about having a boyfriend and made comments that pointed out how old he was. He left me alone after that. 

I'm planning on going through all those books and getting rid of every single one over the winter break so that I don't have to be reminded of his face anymore when I see them sitting in my garage.

12/14/2017 9:32:57,"This is ultimately complicated and it is too long, detailed, and confusing for anyone to bother reading, but I need to share this because this story has ended up being one of the most traumatic events of my life and I have received no formal support or sympathy from my institution and I just need to state it publicly. 

When I was an associate dean at my liberal arts college several years ago we did not have formal designated Title IX officers, so several of us ended up being the staff to deal with this on an ad hoc basis. I ended up being the person that adjunct faculty and some students came to because I was in the Dean of Faculty office and dealt with curricular matters. The students who came to me had complaints primarily about other students so I moved them onto the Dean of Students, but I sometimes knew the outcome of those cases: nothing. 

In one case, one of our star professors (and another dean) had a son who stalked his ex-girlfriend and her boyfriend and roommates and made threats against her. The school did not intervene until he started to destroy campus property--throwing rocks and bricks through her windows while she was there, and even then it was hushed up and he was not disciplined as would be a student whose father wasn't a faculty darling. 

In another case, while at a campus concert, a female student had been punched and physically attacked by a male student. This male student was well connected; of course nothing happened despite the evidence she had (black eye, numerous witnesses). Most galling to me, the male student who punched her ended up being allowed to go on an international trip to country X with, for which I was the female faculty/staff member chaperoning. When I threatened to quit the trip because he was going to be allowed to go, I was reprimanded. As for the female student who had been punched, she was threatened with disciplinary action because she had been smoking pot at the concert..... The school would not support her or represent her when she took the assault to the local police and local DA. And though the DA initially wanted to pursue the case, a few weeks later he informed her there was just not enough evidence.... 

The worst case was the same year with two international teaching assistants on  (Ms. A and Ms. B) who were being stalked and repeatedly sexually harassed by one of our longer-term adjuncts (Professor Y) who had been given informal supervisory powers over them. Professor Y was good friends Professor Z who ran the division and had seemed to be the one to suggest that Ms. A and Ms. B needed supervision because they were from traditional countries. Professor Z insisted that they could not leave campus (one was married and wanted to visit her husband on the weekends); when I told her that of course she was allowed to leave and yes she could fly back home on a Friday, Professor Z confronted me inappropriately and angrily and explained that both women were ""evil snakes under rocks, slithering, biting"" and so forth. It seemed pretty clear that Professor Z--who at that time was a friend of mine--was also involved in the harassment. I led Ms. A and Ms. B to HR and to the Dean of Students. Once we proceeded with the case, I found that Professor Z's wife, an administrator, threatened Ms. A and Ms. B with deportation; HR and the DOS were entirely doubting of these women--I sat in the meetings and was shocked at the racist, sexist, demeaning questions the female HR director asked of them as if they were too stupid to grasp American life and as if they had tried to seduce Professor Y. My dean told me I needed to stay out of it because I was going on the trip to Country X with Professor Z. I am assuming that both Ms. A an Ms. B had been told by somebody to not talk with me any further. They left campus the last day of classes and I really have no idea what happened to them. I have always felt so angry and upset that I could not do more to help them. 

It was the trip to Country X with Professor Z that was my undoing. This was about three months after my trying to help Ms. A and Ms. B. I had believed that Professor Z and I had been good friends for years and initially we got along well. Once in Country X, Professor Z immediately complained that certain female students on the trip were insulting him and he refused to allow them to take part in certain activities--he made me intervene and insisted he would only speak to them again if they apologized to him personally. (None of us had any idea what exactly they had done, but for the sake of the trip, I told them to just play along and apologize to him, that I knew they had done nothing intentionally wrong and that it must be a cultural miscue that we just didn't get). But everything involving gender became a problem for Professor Z. There were female and male faculty from Country X who served as our guides; Professor Z stirred up problems between them and complained formally to their university about the women. In the mean time, the male students on our trip were behaving like rude Americans. I talked to them many times but I finally blew up at them (I was highly inappropriate here, which I admitted.) At that point, Professor Z, all the all the male students, the local male faculty and staff then isolated me entirely and worse. 

When we got back to the US, I later found out that nearly all the students, Professor Z, and his administrator wife went to my Dean and others and attempted to have me fired. I was eventually shown the written comments the students had reported about me; I've never read more upsetting and devastating comments in my life. They were cruel beyond recognition. I was so distraught and anxious--wondering if the comments were true and how horrible I must be--that I left campus and did not return for another 16 months. Professor Z has never spoken to me since three days into the trip. It has taken me many years to realize that perhaps the strange turn against me was related to how I tried to support Ms. A and Ms. B and how I supported the female student who had been punched by the rich student who was allowed on her trip. I just don't know. It's always been a mystery to me, but completely devastating.

Once in a while I hear stories from other faculty and staff that stories circulate about him sexually harassing female students and staff. But because of his politics and professional stature in his fields he is widely beloved by most other faculty and many admiring students. I have no idea what happened to the women in Country X he attempted to get fired, but I have never been able to get over all of this and what a central role he ended up having in the Title IX sorts of cases I was involved with that year. He was somehow always intertwined, but here he remains. I now suspect that the reason he and his wife came to our campus from a far more prestigious institution is that he may have behaved inappropriately before.

12/14/2017 8:22:05,"I originally sent detailed information to the owner of this survey, but have decided to make that content public. In the last 3 years of my career at this institution, I was subjected to numerous incidents of harassment, some sexual and some violent. I will list some of those here:
I interviewed for a faculty position in the same department as an internal staff candidate three times before landing the job, and that was bittersweet. In the first interview, I was told that I lacked experience. I went back to school in order to have the full credentials in case a similar position opened in the future, despite the fact that the individual hired into the job had fewer credentials than I did when she was awarded the position (she was older than I was, didn’t have her degree, and had no teaching experience). When the position opened again, I applied and landed an interview. The day before my interview, I learned that my then-boss had been seated on the hiring committee when he called to make sure that I “wanted to go through with it.” He insisted that, were I to participate in the interview process, he would ensure that I was forced to discuss any job dissatisfaction publicly. He said he would make sure that I had to face him to do it, and he would not recuse himself from his vote to ensure I didn’t get the job. I heard that I was not the committee’s choice because I did not seem interested in the position in the interview. I was terrified of retaliation for interviewing right in front of my current supervisor. On the third opening, I interviewed and was offered the position but was told by another male member of the faculty that the male administrator in charge of the hiring decision did not want to place me in the position because I had small children. He feared I would turn it into an online-only position so that I could be at home with my children. Thus the rationale for the issues with the first two applications. When he called to offer me the job, he made it clear that I was not his first choice. They had split one position into two, and he hired his choice into the other position. She had no children and was openly lesbian.
When my replacement for the position I willingly (and enthusiastically after the first interview experience) chose to leave was hired, she began to approach my office, which was next to hers, for advice. She was continuously complaining about how badly she was being treated by the staff in the new department, and I genuinely believed her and felt sorry for her. However, after several months of coming in late in the evenings to do her job for her (she also complained that no one would train her and she lied on her resume about her experience and was trying to cover it up), I had had enough. I was pregnant, and my pregnancy had been upgraded to extremely high risk so I decided to fall back to my work and my work only. The threats started immediately. She would come into my office, close the door, and tell me how she knew “how to get people” because HR “always believes the person who files first.” She said she had made friends with the new HR director, who didn’t know how to do her job, so this woman had kindly allowed her to borrow some of her textbooks so she could learn how HR in higher ed really worked. This meant she had a friend in the department who would believe anything she said. She told me that she couldn’t have children, and that I was an irresponsible parent for not staying at home with mine. She told me a story about beating an ex so badly with a baseball bat that he was sent to the hospital and said she wouldn’t hesitate to do that again if anyone “got in the way of her professional career.” I believed her- I actually tried to look this up in arrest records to see if there had been anything documented but couldn't find that information. I was absolutely terrified of this woman. I stopped using my office. Her staff used it as a thoroughfare (there were two doors- one into the department and one to the hallway). They would disrupt my work constantly, even in meetings with students, to open one door and walk through with their mail cart. This was an extremely tight area- the office itself was essentially a storage closet- so anyone in chairs in front of my desk had to stand up and move a chair when they were hit by the door. The staff called it their “easement” and said it was their right to walk through whenever they wanted. I begged campus admin to install a lock only accessible from the inside to keep them out of my area. The request was initially denied. In that case I got the union involved, but the grievance officer told me that I “shouldn’t start too much trouble because they didn’t want to hire me in the first place.” I guess I had been warned. It took several weeks to have the lock installed, and the installation only served to further anger the people in my previous department.
As the co-worker’s behavior continued to escalate, I feared violence because things were clearly getting worse. I went to campus admin first and begged to relocate my office. The request was denied, despite ample office space on campus, and I was told to “stop starting trouble” when I explained that this was due to harassment. I then went back to the union grievance officer to explain the harassment, and he told me that there was nothing in the situation that could be grieved- it was my own fault for continuing to expand my family, and I should expect that people would treat me badly because of that. He complained that we women felt “entitled” to things and that we just needed to leave well enough alone. After the grievance was denied, I walked into the faculty lounge to hear him discussing my status as “a breeder” with another faculty member. One commented that I must be addicted to sex because I was having so many children so closely together. At that point I knew my job was short-lived. I had no union support. I privately messaged another female faculty member through Facebook, and she confirmed that this was a pattern for this individual as he did have issues with some of the female faculty. Unfortunately most of the other female faculty worked on other campuses, so I was isolated. I had been warned in the beginning that I was not to send emails complaining to anyone- ever- and if I put anything into writing the union would see that my position was eliminated. I had nowhere to turn, and I kept my mouth shut.
Shortly thereafter I was called into HR and confronted with “evidence” that I had been harassing this woman. She had been filing complaints on me almost as soon as she started, as I was working long hours with her- for free- to help train her because she told a believable sob story. I was not permitted to see anything. They pulled two Facebook posts which she stated were threatening her. One post was random song lyrics to a song I was listening to while on my computer at home. They were in reference to my treatment through the union, though I did not mention this in the post, but I was presented with nothing else so beyond “this isn’t about her” there wasn’t much of a defense. How can you even disprove that? I was told that I couldn’t talk about the situation with anyone to build my own defense, and I couldn’t see any of the other evidence against me. I was told that I deserved to be threatened and treated so badly. I was stunned into silence. I’ve never been treated so cruelly, and I was 7 months pregnant at that point, told them I was high risk and the stress of it alone could be too much, and they shrugged it off. No one cared. No one. When I left the HR office I didn’t even know they had spoken with staff- only a select few people my accuser had named and who I believe she threatened because they reported directly to her. I was told that the grievance officer had already provided evidence to the administration that I was the person being harassed and had been trying to get away from her, and that the union handled it and it would “all be over soon.” I went home and immediately to bed. I was so devastated, and terrified that I might lose the baby under the stress of the situation. I had two days to come up with a defense without seeing anything in the evidence file, and for those two days I was house-bound. Beyond “I didn’t do this” I really had nothing to go on. I did not know until the second day that the complaints had continued in my absence because this woman believed me to be on campus. Additional charges were filed that I was “bursting into tears” in my classes and that students were coming into the department to confront the individual responsible. I had not been on campus, nor had any contact with my students. My classes were formally canceled and I had submitted sick leave, but none of that was even checked. The head of the union called me that evening, through clenched teeth, to tell me that I had “driven the final nail into the coffin” of my career at that institution and that, if I did not come back to work and do the remainder of my job, the union would ensure I never worked in higher ed again. 
",Full time faculty,"Original accuser was staff (subordinate), union leadership was senior tenured faculty",Other Type of School,Southern State Community College,Prefer not to answer,,"I was in the process of being terminated when the union finally decided to grieve the matter, but the same male grievance officer told me that he intended to file the grievance with the statement that it was my “pregnant woman hormones” causing all of the issues. I again stressed the violent threats and harassment, and he laughed at me and told me that he knew how “women like me” worked. I second-guessed wearing a wire to that meeting, and I deeply regret that I did not do so. 
When the head of our union became involved, he pushed very hard for me to resign so he didn’t have to deal with it. The calls to my home were constant and threatening. He told me that I should stay at home and be a mother to my children. That I was doing them a disservice by working and he was sure my place was really at home anyway. I was completely devastated.
Only after I was officially released, as my contract was ending, was I permitted to meet with anyone to address the charges. Only after I was officially released was I able to see the full file against me- full of lies which some have later admitted they told in fear of retaliation for their own positions. When I received that file I cried for weeks. How can you possibly defend something you've never even seen? I was the first, but I wasn’t the last. Most people connected to this situation were either marginalized, forced into retirement, left for other opportunities, or terminated. This experience was financially devastating.",She was promoted from staff to faculty. As far as I know there was zero disciplinary action taken on her. It seems like she was rewarded for her role in this.,"Finding new work was relatively easy, which is why I chose not to fight harder for the job I was losing. Sometimes you just have to cut your losses. I will say that I still fear further retaliation, however, and I therefore stay completely away from all campuses and anyone who I know still works there. I avoid any conferences or other professional gatherings where I believe this woman will be in attendance because if the burden of proof really is on the accused, unless there are cameras present all the time she can say whatever she wants and get away with it. She has already proven that she knows how to work the system.","I changed almost all of my usual patterns- where I shop, events I would ordinarily attend, etc. I had panic attacks for years when the phone would ring because for a while they were only union calls and they were always threatening. Some of the individuals participating in the harassment have showed up at my home. I've considered moving many times. To this day a certified letter causes an instant panic attack.","I am far less trusting of everyone, and coworkers in particular are kept at a huge distance. Most don't know the names of my children. Still others don't even know I have children. No one knows where I live. I do not socialize with colleagues at all outside of work. I'm certain that this has hurt me professionally, as I do work with some amazing people now who have formed a ""work family"" around each other. I'm always on the outside. It's the only way I can keep a handle on the fear, but I also know I can't share that with anyone because once the seed of bias is planted it has no choice but to grow. Had they just said ""we are eliminating your job"" I would've been upset but it didn't have to come this. Questioning my integrity and professionalism was intentionally hurtful, and that's something I will never get past.","There are a few select individuals who are to be held responsible for the actions here, but I want to stress that the institution as a whole did try to make this right once the female faculty took over the union leadership. It was just too little, too late, and it wasn't worth pursuing. I was treated so differently because the lies were initially all that people knew. I couldn't go back to that, despite a decade of loyal service and a perfect work record.

When I started, I did not know what would be the international standards to present doctoral thesis at international conferences etc. Me and other female PhD students were held back a lot, whereas a male and politically active PhD student who started later was pushed to present at these conferences right from the beginning. This was even harder as I and other female PhDs were buried with more administrational work than the male colleagues and my PhD supervisor started to use ideas from my thesis as his. I experienced this afterwards, too, that he would do this with his other female PhD students. He would work with us intensely and if some other male professor said something against it, he started to say he never knew what we were doing and that it's bad and irrelevant. These things piled up during the PhD and afterwards he would push the new head of the department into the same direction telling that I wouldn't do interesting stuff. This person then said that someone like me cannot work in such an exotic field and he took up some ideas himself - and told me, that he expected his PostDocs to kneel in front of him as he did 20 years ago. They tried hard to get me out of my contract and when I tried to go to higher instances at the university, some people started to mutter that this might come out of a former sexual relationship that I might have stopped. Such nonesense! In the end, I got no help, so I quit my position. There were quite a few more in a similar situation, 3 quit, others worked until they reached their habilitation without any help of their male supervisor, on the contrary, many of them tried to make this way as hard as possible for them. One thing I have to add that 20 women got this tenure position to push females in university position, but it seems that especially those had the hardest time. 4 years later the new head of the university gave an order to do a study on the problems, I was interviewed and all interviewers were shocked what happened to me and most other women in this cohort.

12/14/2017 4:48:59,"I was an undergraduate student on a nationally competitive speech team. I was romantically pursued by one of the graduate assistant coaches on the team, and willing began dating him before the school year began (aware of the power dynamics but believed they wouldn't matter). A month into dating, he was acting very controlling and his behavior was making me uncomfortable (he would demand that I break plans to hang out with him, would call and text me at all hours, was acting jealous about me hanging out with my family). Shortly after this behavior began, he sexually assaulted me at his house during our first sexual encounter. Confused and traumatized by the situation, I ended the relationship several weeks later. I didn't report it to the director of the speech team (I was afraid it would hurt the program), but requested to him that he not have any contact with me.

He went so far as standing outside of the window and staring at me while I was performing. After the tournament, he confronted me at school yelling at me and accusing me of sleeping with a man I barely knew that he saw me speaking with in the hallway at the tournament (I did not have sex with that man btw). I had to continue traveling with him for a year to tournaments despite concerns for my own safety. I continually tried to be nice to him, but had to eventually be cold and sometimes outright angry to him publicly in an effort to protect myself and get him to leave me alone.

12/14/2017 3:41:12,"I was hired as a PhD student abroad, along with one other PhD student to run a very ambitious project in a remote part of Africa (countries left out for anonymity).  We were very dependent on each other because we were regularly going between countries, thus experiencing 3-way cultural shock, had minimal other support on this project, etc. Early in the relationship he let me know of his strong attraction to me, despite having just been married at home (wife there), and the ""tug of war"" relationship began.  I always said no and he always pressured me.  It got to the point where I was scared to stay late at work if he was around, and I locked my office door.   About 9 months into our PhD, I gave in.   I had been pressured to drink at work (pretty common, and I usually said no because I didn't like drinking with my male colleagues, although I like drinking).   It was pouring rain (cold, winter rain = suffering for a tropical man) and we both missed the last bus.  I lived about halfway between his house and school, so we walked to my house, and I said he could crash (I only had one futon).

This came as a total surprise as I had not had sexual contact to my knowledge in over six months. 

[Note: I am sharing this story to show how complex and nuanced harassment can be.  I consider this story one of cross-cultural relationships gone wrong coupled with feelings of isolation and depression, and I think it is very common. In retrospect, I do not consider myself a victim and him a perpetrator in the classic sense.  I find it empowering to think about how I could have prevented the situation.  I also think about what academic communities and institutions could do to prevent this story from happening this way, because it was and still is a huge burden that hinders my academic productivity, and I doubt that I am alone.]","PhD Student, 1st year","PhD Student, 1st year (same)",Other R1,"more specificallly, instute of technology / polytechnic",engineering / geosciences,,"1) When I went to the Social Services office, the first social worker that I saw told me that it was my fault for being so isolated and that I really should have joined singing groups (note, I am an awful singer).

They said that unless I had documented example of harassment or mobbing, as it is called in French, for examples emails, there was absolutely no way to bring it up officially. 
2) When I told my project manager, he just laughed and told me that he suspected this could happen and that he thought I shouldn't tell anyone else. Somehow, I imagined him congratulating my perpetrator later on. 
3) Years later, I went to the university presidency's office and told them that I thought the University should put in place a diversity training that would help prevent this sort of story and support for people who experience harassment.  They told me that the University didn't want any bad press around the issue.  That this isn't Canada or the U.S. and that in this country, these are domestic issues, and should be dealt with at home.  The university cannot interfere in personal issues.

He burdened a guilt from me terminating a pregnancy due to his religious beliefs that I don't have because of my own beliefs. ,"I terminated the pregnancy, but had to delay my departure for our huge field campaign/deployment until 3 days after the procedure.  The field season immediately following the incident, there were so many decisions to make and so much to do, and he just kept blaming me for everything.

This created huge gaps in our data set and inconsistencies in our method. 

A few years later we arranged things so that we were never in the same country at the same time.  Eventually though, we had to be in the same country and defend our dissertations.  There were still some moments where he came into my office, at night, with pent up range and yelled at me and punched things and expressed too much emotion.  Sometimes I felt threatened, more often I felt accused.  I started never staying late without a friend with me.  It made finishing my PhD quite hard.

12/13/2017 21:13:33,"My advisor had a history specifically with his female students. When I started school, immediately I heard rumors about his actions in the past, how he fraternized with undergraduates in his classes, how his female graduate students continually had to endure harassment while his male graduate students did not. He would frequently take us out for drinks in the hopes of getting us drunk, at which point he would always become handsy. I remember being on a conference trip with him and several other graduate students, and we were having dinner. I was sitting at a table next to him and he leaned over and whispered in my ear that he thought my tongue was ""pretty sexy"". I was eating my dinner and I felt his hot breath move my hair next to my cheek. Repulsion doesn't begin to cover it. Another time I walked into my office, which I shared with several other graduate students, and the lights were off. When I entered the room, he walked quickly up from behind me and put himself flush against my back. Basically we were touching shoulder to knees all the way down--I felt everything. Fortunately there was an office mate of mine who had been working in the back corner in the dark (just her computer light on), and when it all happened it was right in eye sight of her. I was startled and must have made a noise because she looked up and he bolted. The worst one though wasn't physical, it was verbal. I was in a small conference room working on a talk I was about to give with a colleague from overseas that I had met only two days before. My advisor walks into the room, sees me and this other gentleman working, we're the only two in the room, and says ""oh, hello, nice quarters you have here. But then again, Sara (not my real name), knows what it's like sharing tight quarters with me, don't you, Sara."" By now the other gentleman has stopped working and looks over at me. I am frozen, I have absolutely no idea what he is talking about, I had never shared a room with him in my life. The other gentleman goes ""Uhhh, what do you mean, Steve (not his real name)?"" And my advisor goes ""Oh, Sara and I have plenty of stories we could tell. There have been plenty of times I came back to the hotel and Sara is just laying in bed naked. I always have to cover her up."" And then he just laughs like its a joke and walks out the door. I look at my newly-met colleague and try my best to assure him I have absolutely no idea what my advisor was talking about. All while feeling like I wanted to throw up, punch a wall until my fingers bled, run until my legs gave out, and cry all at the same time. It ebbed and flowed throughout my PhD. However, the conference trips were never negotiable among his graduate students, he fully expected you to attend each one with him. The pressure to do so at times was intense. I felt that if I didn't go on trips with him and take part in these ""outings"" that I wouldn't get a letter of rec, or that he'd start ignoring me in favor of his male or other female graduate students, or that he'd make the rest of my time during my degree hard. There are many, many more stories just like this with my advisor, and some other female graduate students of his may have had it worse than me. But honestly the worst part is the reputation that has followed me. Even before I came to work with him, Steve had earned a reputation regarding his female graduate students. I am in a STEM field and needless to say there have been plenty of times where I've heard ""ohhhh, you're one of Steve's grad students, huh?"" always with a smirk. It's like the four years I worked my ass off to earn my PhD was for nothing, because peers in my field think I slept my way to it.

It makes me question my right to be an assistant professor, like I really didn't earn my PhD, that I was given an easier road because I was a female in Steve's [not his real name] research group.

I brought my husband, as I was wary.  The professor told my husband he could not come in but instead, would have to sit out on the steps of the dark, unheated hallway.  When I entered the apartment, I saw that the lights were dimmed and there was only candlelight. On the coffee table, there was was a bottle of wine and 2 wine glasses.  We talked vaguely about my research paper (I was sure he had not read it). He kept inviting me to come to the back of the apartment so that we could look over his file cards together in search of sources for my project.  I declined.  I left.  I knew he was gay (he was ""out,"" even in that era) and so I could make no sense of that evening.  I knew, nevertheless, that something was very wrong. That limited discussion was the last feedback I got on my work during those two years.  Whenever I turned anything in,  asked for a grade or feedback, he would say that he didn't have time for office hours. Instead, I should come to his apartment. After the first semester working with him, I did go by his office to pick up my graded final (which he would not give me).  Instead, he pulled out a student's course evaluation and accused me of writing it. (It wasn't mine, but I could have written that very negative evaluation of the course.) He screamed at me, told me he would ""get me"" for that evaluation.   I told the DGS (a female at that time) that I was not comfortable working with this professor and that he would not return my work and refused to make office appointments. Yet I did not have the words to explain what was happening, especially because everyone knew he was gay.  The DGS was dismissive and said that all advisee-director relationships were difficult and that it was up to me to make it work. When it came time for my exams, my director was still refusing to meet with me and then told me he would fail me.  When a new DGS, a complete mensch, heard what was happening (my work had completely stalled, I was getting no feedback, had no direction...), everything changed.  I quickly was given a new and better adviser and the offender was taken off my committee entirely.(He later was denied tenure.)  So I did come out of it OK.

12/13/2017 19:07:14,In 1986 I found a hand written letter (several pages long) in my campus mailbox from my advisor which specified in great detail his sexual feelings for me and what he wanted to do with my body.  I was his teaching assistant in a grad level methods course at the time.  He had made other comments in the past year indicating his interest in me which I always deflected.,Second year grad student and teaching assistant,Tenured faculty and my advisor,Other R1,University of Minnesota-Minneapolis,Sociology,,"The Grad Advisor heard my story, escorted me to the Department Chair, who informed a campus office that dealt with harassment.  I was immediately removed from the teaching assignment and replaced by a senior male grad student.  I was provided with a research internship instead. I was advised as to my options and eventually I filed a formal complaint.","There was no public announcement. It took several months for the complaint to be resolved.  Because this was the first formal complaint against him, he was forbidden from having female students as advisees or employees for some period of time. However, he went away on sabbatical the following year, so this restriction was not consequential.  Several women privately confided about his harassing behavior with them but none were willing to come forward with a formal complaint.  As part of my agreement with the institution, he was to apologize to me in front of the department chair.  He botched the delivery, making it sound like he was apologizing for me complaining against him. ","I failed my statistics exam that quarter, dropped the class and did not pursue further training in that method. It took me an extra year to complete my master's degree, and the department supported me for that year.  It took me three years after that to regain confidence to return to graduate school for my PhD. I started over in a whole new field, at a new university, so it took me even more years to complete the PhD.   It made me highly cautious of close relationships with male faculty.  Although I eventually found supportive decent male human beings to serve on my committee, I kept an emotional distance and did not receive the mentoring and support offered to students who closely aligned their research with their advisor's.  I did not view faculty as sources of career support and they have not been.  My career has succeeded because of network connections I made in my field of study.  I am not in a tenure track faculty position.  ","I was devastated at the time. I was not referred to counseling.  I was scared and angry and uncertain of myself and how my removal from the course assignment would be perceived by my peers.   I became deeply depressed.  It was a bleak Minnesota winter, which didn't help.  

I saw the harasser years later at our professional meeting where he had been honored with an achievement award.  He was sitting in a circle with my husband who was in the same sub-field.  I was traumatized at seeing these two people together and at knowing this harasser kept his career while mine was floundering. My husband had no idea who this man was to me at that time."," I was a first generation college student and had no idea how to navigate the system or understand my place within academia.  31 years later, I recognize both negative and positive impacts of this experience on my life.   Negative impacts include ongoing struggles with confidence in my ideas and writing and ability to make a significant contribution to my field - the ""impostor syndrome.""    Positive impacts include moving to another state, discovering critical politics and feminism as lenses to understand how power and gender work in the academy. I was lucky the harasser hand wrote the letter as it was clear evidence of his behavior and not a he said/she said situation.  I married a feminist man.  I maintain and reinforce clear relationship boundaries in professional situations and am a staunch advocate for victims of harassment.

12/13/2017 18:58:45,"I was working as a counselor at a summer camp that taught competitive public speaking to high school students when I was sexually assaulted by a fellow male counselor.
He and I had known each other since I was a freshman in college. It wasn’t obvious. He wasn’t awful to be around and there were many points in my life where, if you asked, I would have called him a friend. He didn’t make rape jokes, or call women “bitches.” He was a successful competitor and coach in an activity that prides itself on holding a mirror to the world so it can see all the injustice.
We worked a few camps together, which usually involves late nights cutting scripts and drinking. Over the years he kept pushing the line. He would befriend whomever I was dating or had just broken things off with to create an illusion of safety. I started to get really uncomfortable when we would go out in groups, because I would always feel his eyes on me. He started to act like he was entitled to me. He started to unhook my bra in public places as a “joke.” When I told him I didn’t want to do that, he called a group of guys over to tell them how lame I was being for not playing along. So I was complicit, and played along.
I had a drinking problem, and he knew it. I hated myself, and he knew it. He always waited to try something when we were out in a group drinking, because I had a party girl role that I played well. It was almost too easy to write me off if I ever said anything.

12/13/2017 18:13:03,"I don’t know if this story counts as harassment, but it involves sex-related behavior in the workplace that had different consequences for the man vs the women involved. A former colleague who was a serial flirt caused drama in my department for years. He engaged in behaviors that most women would interpret as being hit on: flattering appearance, dropping by the office to chat for no reason and asking personal (but not too personal) questions, even touching that was not clearly sexual but beyond what one usually encounters in a professional setting – a shoulder or a wrist. That is as far as it progressed with me; I don’t know if it went further with others. When I mentioned it to a female colleague she told me that this man was a “terrible flirt” and cautioned me not to take him seriously. She told me about a woman had taken him seriously and had been badly embarrassed when her crush on him became the subject of office gossip, while the man acted befuddled and made sure everyone understood the crush was unrequited and that it was she who pursued him, not the reverse. The woman was no longer in the department when I arrived. I don’t know her and don’t know if the incident affected her departure. But over the next few years, I observed the man following the same pattern with new hires who were pretty young women. Others observed as well and gossiped about it, but the gossip always put the woman in a bad light while sparing the man. People would speculate about a woman’s interest in the man, often in unflattering ways that approached slut-shaming or implied she was pathetic for not realizing this was just what he did. To my knowledge, no one ever told him to stop, but I know that on at least one occasion he was told that some women considered him flirtatious. He feigned ignorance and innocence and protested that everyone knew he was married. And then the behavior continued, for years. I doubt I am the only one who felt it was problematic but it was hard to pin down. After all, many women are attracted to men. But I don’t think his behavior was irrelevant and I don’t think it was innocent. Too many women were subjected to ugly gossip and workplace distraction while the man got a pass for toying with people and causing drama.

Every other female student went along with the harassment but me, and most had sex with him and/or other professors, so I guess it really bothered him that I refused and thus I became a target. He put me on the spot in front of other professors about why I refused to ""socialize"" with him at his private home.

After I became dean and the department went back to male leadership, there were two male faculty members (both married), including the chair, blatantly having sexual relationships with grad students: one ended up raping a student while she was knocked out on meds, leaving her pregnant. Already emotionally fragile, she terminated and then spent time in a psych facility trying to deal with the issues.  The women themselves would not come forward because of the power pressure, but their peers came forward, both to voice their concerns and to complain about their perceptions of preferential treatment in the grad program. Both men ultimately felt that these relationships were ""justifiable"" or ""ethical""  because they ended up marrying their grad students, the most fragile of whom (the one who had been raped) gave up her graduate education, entered a marriage full of emotional and physical abuse, became a stereotypical version of the ""barefoot and pregnant"" cliche, and only recently divorced her husband (who, no surprise! was fooling around with grad students). Neither of those faculty members are still employed here, but it took forever to get a policy in place that addressed faculty/student relationship issues.

12/13/2017 9:43:58,"I am a black queer woman. Straight out of my PhD program, at my first job (an English department) I was assigned a faculty mentor who was an older tenured white straight man in the department. We had a mutual friend so I thought that was perhaps why we were paired. Two months into the job, we went to attend a film screening of our mutual friend. He drove us to the train station an hour away. He was late picking me up and when he arrived he smelled like alcohol. He told me he had had a late night partying celebrating the release of his most recent book. As we drove he behaved erratically, shouting about how beautiful the sky and trees were, sometimes not staying in the lane on the road. It became clear to me he was more than drunk, likely under the influence of another drug. Multiple times he asked me personal questions about my status as single, what bars I go to, etc. Three times he reached over and touched my thigh in the car. At one point he told me it must be hard to be a single woman at the bar because when he goes to the bar as a single man, people don't assume he's there to get laid. I was texting a fellow black woman colleague in the department about it the entire time, half laughing half scared. We parted ways once we got to the location of the film screening, but met up again at the after party. He was drinking and kept trying to get me and my friend (another black queer woman) to dance with him, grabbing and kissing our hands and pulling on our arms. My friend disclosed to me that she had met him a few times before and recalled him getting in a fight with her girlfriend at a birthday party because he would not back off aggressively flirting with her. I slept at my friend's place and traveled back with my mentor the next day. He was sober and acted like nothing strange had occurred. He even asked me some of the same professional questions he asked the day before, as if he had no memory of asking me before.
At work the next week, the black woman colleague I had texted told me she was sorry, she had heard he had an alcohol and maybe drug problem before, but thought it was pure rumor. My mentor stopped speaking to me entirely, never scheduling any other meetings nor a teaching observation for me that semester (nor the following one). After a few weeks of feeling panicked about running into him and not sure who I could trust I told the director of diversity and inclusion (another black woman). She was upset and said that my department should never assigned me to him as a mentee because there was a history of known problems with him. She encouraged me to tell my chair, but I was too scared. I was in my first semester and didn’t know who was loyal to this person, who I could trust.
After no interaction (and no mentoring) with him for the rest of my first year, the chair e-mailed us both asking for a report from my mentor about our meetings and my progress in the first year. I agreed to meet my mentor for the first time in over seven months on campus during the day so I could give him some information on what I had been doing for his mentor report. He no-showed to the meeting, e-mailing after to say he had confused the time. He asked me to simply e-mail him my CV and he would write a report from that. At that time, we had just elected a new incoming chair who was a black man. I met with him shortly after this and told him in cautioned, vague terms that I had had this interaction in which he seems intoxicated or otherwise under the influence and then he stopped speaking to me or mentoring me the rest of the year. I did not mention the sexual nature of parts of that interaction. The incoming chair listened to my story and then said “So that’s still a problem then. I didn’t know.” He wouldn’t say more, but promised to assign me a new mentor.
No one followed up with me or reported what occurred to HR. The following year I tweeted at a student protest and received online racial and sexual harassment, including hate mail sent to my campus mail. My department and university provided little assistance or support. I went on the market the next year and have since left that university. They did not do an exit interview to find out why I was leaving even though I was a diversity hire and my former department has a record of losing the majority of the faculty of color it hires. My former mentor has been promoted to full professor.

In my first few weeks, female staff and faculty flooded into my office to complain about sexual harassment. One male faculty member in particular was named but there was a small pocket of his cronies who engaged in inappropriate sexual, intimidating, and threatening comments.  I reported this to HR (as did another female administrator) and over the next 2 months, several females were interviewed about their experiences. By the end of my first semester, I was able to have the main harasser reassigned to the main campus but HR said his behavior wasn’t sexual harassment.  His group of cronies immediately began their campaign to drive me out of my position.  In spring semester, one of male faculty was overheard by a male student referring to me as a “stupid cunt”.  It was reported by myself and the male student to HR but they refused to take any action; HR’s explanation was that HR would be embroiled with the union and the harasser would claim freedom of speech.

12/13/2017 7:31:10,"I was at first sexually harassed by a colleague and friend. He was in a more senior position than mine and he constantly told me that he wanted to date me, thought I was hot etc. I had constantly explained he was just my friend. I had no other friends-- i had just moved to the university from western Canada and he had become my only friend.
I continued to try to maintain a friendship because he was a work colleague but i stopped spending time with him.
Finally I caved to his requests to spend time together. He knew I was struggling with studying for classes so he offered to help me study and explain some concepts to me. That night he sexually assaulted me in my residence when I fell asleep when I was studying (He was there to help me study as he had done similar grad school work). I had said no several times but he just still did it.  After he got off me I walked straight into the bathroom and turned on the shower and started sobbing. He just left the apartment without saying a word.

I tried to make sense of what he had done. Tried to make it ok for me. So I flirted with him and it drove him crazy.  but I never ever let him touch me again.  I am ashamed of all of that. 

I wasn't sleeping or eating and I knew something was wrong. I had a grad student in my class who worked with survivors. She said something in class one day and It just clicked that I should ask her. So I asked her to go for coffee. I told her what had happened but she had to say to me ""how many times did you say no?""  And I explained that It was 4 or 5 times. And then she asked ""How many times do you thinj you should have to say no?"" That is when I finally understood. And that was also when I understood that when I was 14, my first boyfriend also sexually assaulted me. I had always just said he had ""forced me."" But it then made sense why I wouldn't recognize someone not respecting my boundaries.

That was weeks later that I figured out what had happened to me. I hadn't understood what coercion meant. He called me and I asked him how many times I had said no. And he acknowledged that I had said it several times. I didn't record him unfortunately.

I tried to hold him accountable with the university for sexual harassment. But he had never written any of his comments in emails. And I included the sexual assault in my testimony.  But when they found out that I flirted with him after the assault, then they turned down my case. I appealed to the university president and he also turned it down.

I left grad school. I couldn't work with that man. I couldn't sit through staff meetings looking at him. My work on campus (it was an assistantship) was part of our grad studies. I couldn't afford grad school without the job.

 I was suicidal. But one professor stood up for me. He got me a new assistanceship in another part of campus and convinced me to return to grad school. I managed to finish my second year and graduate.

I was one of several staff members who he targeted to ""help him with a lab."" Turned out he was trying to videotape us changing our clothes so he could masturbate to the images.

Because of my previous experience Idecided (unlike all the other targeted victims) to join the only other colleague who would do somethint about it and we made them.charge him criminally. The police hadnt wanted to charge him despite his numerous attempts to videotape people. The university did nothing to support us. Laughingly they recommended thst i  speak to a counsellor on campus-- she was someone i worked with! We won the case and he has a criminal record went on probation and lost his job. He was only a couple years from getting his pension which he is now enjoying profusely.  So really not much consequence for him... We on the other hand both had to leave that department. She got fired for talking openly about the incident. I left for another job because I felt so uncomfortable.

I personally encountered many off-color jokes, complaints about individual ""feminist"" scholars or feminist approaches in general, comments on personal appearance, and the expectation that female graduate students shoulder the burden in setting up spaces and catering for events. (Graduate students in the program were responsible for setting up for most of the lectures and receptions, involving everything from moving tables and chairs to making cheese plates and setting out reception tables. Unsurprisingly, the brunt of this work fell to the female students.) My advisor, whose students were mainly young, attractive women, once jokingly referred to us as his ""harem."" After I had informed him of my decision to leave his institution and go elsewhere, a conversation that went relatively calmly, he later sent me a (probably drunk) email late at night with personal recriminations about my leaving and about the professors at the other institution to which I was transferring. (At no time did he address one of the main reasons for my departure -- an institutional environment openly hostile to queer students and scholars.) In general I encountered a ""boys club"" feeling, especially in certain departments. A different senior professor once sent an email addressed to a number of female graduate students and a junior, untenured professor, in which he had composed a poem about us; I think he intended it to be flattering, but it was definitely very weird and creepy, especially as he included a reference in one line to one student's six year old daughter, and also a reference to his genitalia.

I was shocked by how accepting everyone seemed of this. I spoke to the HoD, asking - are these rumours true? He said they were, but wrung his hands, saying, ""there's nothing we can do."" I was devastated! He said if confronted, the colleague would simply lie, subtly pointing out that the man's wife was head of HR for the whole University. He said - what I will do is move the student out of his office, which they were sharing(!). He got her her own office, and that was meant to be that. I looked up the University's code of ethics governing staff-student relationships and you could drive a truck through it. It turned out he'd written it. I felt sick about it all but couldn't see any action to take, particularly given other colleagues were turning a blind eye. One who worked in feminist philosophy remarked that the students concerned were over the age of consent and she didn't hold with 'seeing women as victims'. A few years later a complaint came in from the high schools where we taught Ethics and guess who was super-keen to go out there and deliver it? The complaint was about inappropriate contact after hours (texting) with a 16 year old girl. I was so upset. The University only investigated after certain people pushed hard from inside. I never found out the results, and the colleague remained in place until he died of alcohol-related illness. 
What I want to comment on re. all this is that given the colleague was employed for over 30 years, how very many female students must have been caught up in the behaviour - and what happened to their educations? (If any are reading this, please consider that you may have been abused, even if you thought it was consensual.)

He was in an unhappy marriage, didn't have many friends, and described his personal life with her at length to me.  I answered his questions by carefully skirting around them and re-directing the conversation to neutral ground: he didn't seem bothered by my lack of engagement in any of it, and seemed relieved for an opportunity to share his thoughts and feelings freely (he should have just gone to therapy). When I rejected the proposition to have sex with him (which shocked me) I stammered that I wasn't comfortable mixing business and pleasure. He became defensive and embarrassed.

Two weeks later we met in his office to go over the things I needed to begin my next set of experiments. He closed the door and told me I didn't deserve any of it, had an arrogant and entitled approach to science, and that unless I mended our relationship, would never have a future in science since he held all power over my future. Further, he reneged on a previously arranged agreement to allow me flexibility to TA for additional semesters to make my financial ends meet. He forbid me to find external employment, and told me just to deal with it - knowing I was under financial duress.

At the end of the spring semester, I confronted the latter about potentially needing an exam deferral due to my mother being diagnosed with cervical cancer. The second professor responded, ""Don't worry, she'll be okay. My Mom had breast cancer and she's boobless now. It'll all work out."" I found out days later that they had granted an exception to a male student to have the exam emailed to them as they would be out of the country the day it was scheduled. Days after the exam, I received an email from them wishing my Mother well without actually apologizing for what was said. After a year of repeatedly being told I wasn't good enough to stay in the course sequence , I abandoned working with those faculty and turned my work in a different direction.

12/10/2017 18:10:20,"My grad program (late nineties, early 2000's) had a culture of constantly accusing people of having affairs. WIth the possible exception of undergrads, people at all ranks participated, including support staff. Sometimes these accusations were within the bounds of moral condemnation, I.e., people claimed to have uncovered abuse of a subordinate, but often they were just a sort of malicious slash fiction, with political allies or even people who worked in similar areas accused of having sex with one another, with their grad students, with their famous dissertation directors, etc. It was never clear to me as a student what sparked a particular story; after a while, one simply expected a new one every semester. As I think on it I realize that the accusations always hit those who could conceivably move on from the department--successful grads, junior fac, and the few minor stars among associate and fulls--never the deadwood, and never the rooted locals among students. So it was a kind of accusation of treason or disloyalty, really: how dare you desire more than this.  

The situation was particularly grim because the city was small, and many faculty and grad students lived and drank in a particular neighborhood only about three-quarters of a mile in diameter; one was literally surveilled in one's private life. This gossip was spread in person, in e-mails, and I have heard reports that there were (implicitly homophobic) allegations against a man (associate prof) in the men's room, as a graffito that was not removed for a long time. At least one person who was a target of what I knew to be false (and again homophobic) rumors spread similar rumors about a colleague, in apparent good faith, and rather carelessly, as an item of mild entertainment. I think perhaps they were not aware of the comparatively more vicious accusations that had been leveled against them, and did not perceive a broader culture of abuse-by-slander. We all lost our moral bearings utterly, I think. 

Eventually, I was accused of sleeping with my director, or rather...not accused directly but suddenly treated as an object of ridicule, with the obvious inference being continually re-drawn. There was zero basis for the rumor other than the fact that we had a congenial relationship, but there were many occasions when I was suddenly asked loaded questions by smirking people I didn't know well, and one memorable incident when I waved hi to some acquaintances (an ABD woman and a full professor man) at an MLA, only to have them pause, glance at eachother, laugh loudly and incredulously in my face, and walk away. 
;
The worst part is, even while being aghast at my own mistreatment, I didn't question many of the rumors I heard about others; I merely congratulated myself on a relative lack of prudishness, or occasionally felt superior because I had good evidence that a particular story was false. Since the ones I knew were false were also the ones that would have been serious abuses of power (involving students), I was complacent. Today, I recognize someone that I believed false stories about in this spreadsheet, and I feel terrible for not being more careful about what I accepted and did not accept as true. I don't think I ever met or spoke to that person except in passing, but I offer her my apologies nonetheless. It seems obvious that her career was profoundly damaged by this situation, and while I couldn't have prevented that, I could have substituted empathy for facile cynicism. ","Ph.D student, ABD, recent grad. I cut contact with nearly everyone from that program relatively quickly after leaving.",All ranks.,R2,"UNiversity at Albany, SUNY",English,,"NOne. The diffuseness of the offenses--which came from everyone and no one, and which were often cloaked in facile feminism, an acceptably mild homophobia, and cheap moralism--militated against even articulating it as a problem, much less finding an institutional solution. I think that this sort of culture, which I have since encountered in a slightly different form elsewhere, is under-recognized as a form of gendered oppression, because no one harm can be attributed to any one actor, and the abuse itself does not follow gender binaries. Men can be attacked, and women can be attackers, and attackers can be attacked. BUt it is always women and queer people who suffer the worst consequences. That's whose reputation does not recover, and that's who (in my experience) feels worst about it.  ","Department imploded catastrophically through general mismanagement and contentiousness, and not directly because of the rumors (though they certainly contributed to the mistrust). Many people who were subject to false rumors have since left the department, either by graduation or changing jobs. Those individuals who only accused others, without ever being accused themselves, have suffered no harms that I know of.","The rumor that I had had sex with my advisor was personally devastating around the time of my graduation and across the next 2-3 years, both because it implied general, public doubt of my capacities, and because it besmirched a good relationship that I was and am grateful for. I did not share the rumor with my advisor, out of a desire to protect them from ugliness, and I have reason to suspect that they never knew. I can't tell if there have been professional consequences for me. I am employed in the profession and relatively well-published for someone with a high teaching load, and given the employment crisis in my discipline, that's a win. ","Surprisingly little--unlike so many on this sheet, I don't and have never felt traumatized or betrayed, and I have never doubted my own talents or right to be a member of the profession.  As noted above, I did feel great sadness and confusion for a few years, but these strike me as appropriate and proportionate feelings to the circumstances.

The way he talked to some of the women and a student worker made us uncomfortable. He and the ED were always together when he was in the office and she was the gatekeeper to any interaction with him.

12/10/2017 8:48:15,"I was invited to a prestigious workshop on a topic that my work is *unquestionably* at the heart of, but the framing of the workshop gendered it strongly male. I am in the humanities, but I imagine a parallel from STEM might be a conference organized around ""Improving Radiology's Approach to Chemotherapy,"" and my work is precisely on making chemotherapy more effective, but I take a biological approach to it (my understanding is that Radiology is gendered more STEM-lord male and biology is gendered female?).

I am one of only 3 females in the 18 person workshop and the other two work in much more classically male-gendered areas. I am also 1 of 2 graduate students involved; everyone else has at least one award-winning book out. The group went out for dinner the night before the conference. Drinks were had; I am an outgoing person and had a lot of fun chatting with those around me. One person from the gendered-male framing field I had never met before or read any of his work. We got along really well and when he mentioned that his daughter was a year younger than me I felt assured that nothing creepy was going on. 

The next day at lunch, he again sits next to me and asks me if I want to go out to a sports event after the conference concludes the next day; because he is one of the conference organizers, he knows my flight leaves the next morning and I am spending another night in town. I start to get wigged out by how he is isolating me from the group, and the fact that he seems to not want anyone else to hear this invitation, so I blow him off saying I think I need to be conducting research in the local archives, I need to check  the holdings, etc. The next day, the final day of the conference he asked me over breakfast again about accompanying him to the sporting event and this time I firmly declined and just said I couldn't. He ignored me all day and except to be dismissive of my paper while everyone else was positive/constructive.

I realized that a smarter way to pay for my education habit would be to be a faculty member.  I was told about an employment opportunity in the university in which I was a student.  I went to an office to speak with the Secretary to the Director.  She scheduled an appointment with the Director.  

I arrived for that appointment, sat across the desk from the Director, and noticed a ""Post-it Note"" (signed by the Secretary) on the Director's desk.  Reading the note upside down, I discovered that (in Spanish) it said, "" ________ __________ 01:00 p.m.  Hire him.  He is a stud.""  The Director was ~ 31 years young.  I was ~ 26 years young.  She scheduled an interview with a committee (but, told me that the job was mine.  Nobody else would be interviewed).  

After I had been hired, she told me that my first day on the job would be spent flying to San Luis Obispo to participate in a conference.  When we arrived and were carrying our bags into the hotel, she told me that I did not need to occupy a separate room.  Oh yes I did!!!!!!!  That comment certainly made me uncomfortable.  

As the weeks of the job went on, she would introduce me to other women telling 
them that she had hired me because of that note from the Secretary.  If I had been pale-skinned, I know that one could have seen that I was blushing.  Those comments certainly did make me uncomfortable.  

When I arrived in that major research university (during the 1970s), I was told by male faculty members and by male students that the unwritten rules of dating were such that; when a man took a woman on a date and paid for a meal in a nice restaurant, the woman reciprocated by inviting him into her body.  I never, ever would consider such disrespectful behavior.  However, my boss consistently would tell me.  ""Your taking me to dinner.""  I would take her to ""Taco Time"" and pay for her meal.  No matter how flirtatious she was, I would not respond in any unprofessional way.  I did not want any relationship with her other than our professional one as administrative, student-services faculty members in the same program.

I was invited to apply for a faculty position in another institution of higher education (which desperately needed somebody who could teach Mathematics in Spanish and in English).  I did not remain two years in that first uncomfortable job.  I probably was helped (in dealing with the boss who wanted me for my body) by being married to the most beautiful woman in the world.    

Those many experiences with that person did not give me any PTSD.  I did not lose sleep because of them.  I did not report them to any university administrators in levels of more authority.  

I finished a B. Sci., M. Sci., and Ph.D. without ever accepting one penny of financial aid, scholarship funds, fellowship funds, student loans, etc.  I finished with no debt.

12/10/2017 0:16:25,"I'm including this here because my harasser, although this occurred when I was in high school (around age 16), is (or was? not sure if he is still employed) a professor; this happened after a summer program in which he was my teacher. I enjoyed his teaching, he said he was impressed by my intellect, and we kept in touch via online chat after the program ended. He also offered to write me a letter of recommendation. Over time, our conversations became less platonic on his instigation, and he moved from complimenting my smarts to complimenting my looks; I was initially flattered by what I naively thought of as romantic interest, then increasingly creeped out as he became more explicitly sexual. At one point he asked to call me on the phone, then during the call described the size of his penis and talked about it growing erect, asked me if the description made me aroused, and asked me to talk dirty to him. He also asked whether he could visit me after I went to college; I politely deflected that.
We stopped talking a little while after that, which was a huge relief for me. I didn't hear from him again until I was a grad student, out of the blue: the institution I attended for my Ph.D. was the same one he'd gone to for undergrad, and I suppose he must have visited for an alumni reunion. I didn't see him, but he somehow located my departmental mailbox and left a note asking how I was and whether I'd like to get back in touch. I did not oblige him.",High school student,Teacher/former teacher (postdoc at the time),Other Type of School,,Classics,,"None. I'm ashamed to admit I did not report this—I felt complicit and guilty about it, since I'd initially had a crush on him.

There was also no untoward physical contact or face-to-face interaction; it was all online or over the phone.",None.,"I still ended up pursuing my interest in the field; the sad thing is that he was genuinely a good teacher and helped to encourage that interest in the first place. In the end, I felt I was able to separate what happened from my intellectual interests; I have been lucky in that respect. If anything, it made me more determined to excel in the field. But I still feel guilty for not reporting him.","It's hard to say. I was a very insecure teenager, and in an odd, terrible way the whole thing was reassuring in its initial stages: it helped me believe that someone (whose intellect and judgment I respected) could find me attractive at a time when I felt I was hideous. I think my feeling of complicity in what happened was the most damaging aspect of the whole occurrence. I do have difficulty saying ""no"" to people, and I don't think this helped.","Again, hard to say. I did end up going into my chosen field, and hope to succeed in it; if it's had any impact, it's that I've been extra-nervous at big conferences, wondering if he'll unexpectedly turn up.

We first met in a formal setting, I made an appointment to ask about American academic culture. We also kept running into each other in town. At some point, months later, he asked me out. Being from a different culture (both social and academic), I did not find it strange that an older guy who happened to be a professor openly expressed interest in me.

He would say ""don't tell anybody, or I will get in trouble"". I never really understood that: there was no conflict of interest... being from different departments, our professional paths didn't really cross. I told my friends about him.

12/9/2017 8:05:49,"I was an assistant professor and had organized a discussion and exhibition around a new arts publication in an off-campus gallery operated by some alumni of my program. Very few of my colleagues came, but the banana-incising senior colleague (reference to my previous post) did. During the course of the discussion, he said, apparently out of the blue, ""I am guided in everything I do by the breasts of [name of mutual female student, also present.]"" The room had a spasm of discomfort as everyone looked to the student he had named. She initiated some anxious laughter and I tried to steer the discussion back on track. A couple of days later, I spoke to the student who minimized the comment. It apparently was a reference to a performance artwork that she had recently made 
in his class, but it was not in any way germane to the discussion. I pointed out that I had a legal obligation to report harassment and that his bringing up her breasts publicly, without the context of the performance, was inappropriate and could have a chilling effect on female students. She was adamant that did not want to pursue a complaint. I sought the counsel of my faculty mentor, who was furious and told me she was going to report it. She wanted to keep me out of it because the senior colleague had a reputation of retaliation. An investigation ensued, which the senior professor easily traced back to me because I was the only colleague present and the only one who had a responsibility to report his inappropriate comment. The senior colleague then proceeded to place ads in the alternative arts newsweekly in which he used hand-drawn comics to explain away his behavior and portray me as a worthless artist in league with the nefarious administration to end free speech and free artistic expression.  The student whose breasts had been discussed publicly did not want to participate in the investigation, and the investigation became politicized, as the department administration was pushing very hard to paint him as unstable to get rid of a professor who had long been a thorn in their side. I was not involved in any of this, but it's my analysis from afar. Eventually, this strategy backfired, and my senior colleague was cleared of the harassment charges. He celebrated his exoneration with a Facebook post calling me and the chair of the department out by name for our unsuccessful attempt to destroy him.

12/9/2017 7:20:36,"After completing my BA and MA at an institution where students and professors did not socialize together, I did my PhD in at an institution that was very informal. It was a bit of a learning curve adjusting to a world in which professors and grad students hung out together, but I found the informality of my new school refreshing. At the orientation, my soon to be harasser walked by a group of new students and said ""are there any [students in my field] in here?"" and then instructed us all to call him by his first name. I loved that. My harasser was irreverent. He swore, wore jeans, and in general shook things up. He drank with his students, spent his free time outside of classes with us, and read my whole MA thesis to learn more about my research. I thought he was exactly what I wanted in a dissertation supervisor: someone invested in me and my work. He was a father to two young women, and I found him incredibly paternal. He looked out for grad students and would often pay for our meals and drinks. He agreed to be my supervisor. I went to Italy the summer of my first year, and when I came back, he took me and my friend for drinks. I remember that night he asked me how to say ""will you @#$%^& me"" in Italian. I brushed it off. That semester, I was applying for fellowships. I asked him if he would write me a letter of recommendation, and he agreed. He asked to meet to go over my CV, but I was worried that if we went out he would pay for everything again (like he always did), and I wanted to show that I was grateful for his time, so I invited him over to my house for dinner. I lived close to campus and couldn't drive, and he didn't have a car at the time, so it seemed like the best option. (I couldn't very well suggest we meet somewhere neither of us could get to without difficulty; my PhD institution was in the middle of nowhere). Also, the culture of the program was so informal that I didn't see anything wrong with this gesture. My roommates were home, and I had a boyfriend at the time. I wasn't worried about him. That night, he came over with a two-liter bottle of wine and proceeded to get very drunk. We talked about my work over dinner, and at the end, I got up to do the dishes. I felt him come up behind me and wrap his arms around my waist and start rubbing my hips. I moved to break away and pretended it never happened. Then, as we sat down, he said ""I'm going to be bad,"" and leaned forward to kiss me. I moved my head away. He tried again, and I remember his lips made contact with mine. I got up and suggested we go somewhere else--perhaps bike over to a bar. We agreed to bike to the one bar on campus and I went to grab a jacket and change my pants to ones I could bike in. When I came back into the room, he said he was just going to go home. At the time, I didn't quite understand what had happened that night. I know—first and foremost--I felt bad for him. I was sure that because he was a father, he would wake up sober and feel terrible. I called my father, sister, and former supervisor, and we all agreed that keeping quiet and my head down would be best. But he spent the next six years terrorizing me. I dropped him off my committee, because I realized I could no longer work with him, and he told other professors in my department that we were no longer working together because I had plagiarized his work. (We work on completely different things). He went out of his way to make me feel small and pick on me as I made my way through my exams and prospectus phase. Then, things got much worse. Since I no longer had a supervisor, I began working—in name, at least—with the soon-to-be retired professor in my department who was in my field. When he retired, they hired someone new--a woman--and my harasser began dating her. Before I knew they had started dating, she and I chatted about my work, and she agreed to be my new supervisor. It made sense: she was the fancy new professor, and I couldn't keep working with someone who had retired. Also, she was a good and careful reader of my work, and I became quite fond of her. I dreaded that she would find out what her boyfriend did to me years ago, and at some point it did come out. I asked her to keep details of my job search from him, and to keep him away from me when she could. She didn't treat me differently, and I was grateful for that.

But my last two years of grad school were deeply traumatizing. My harasser, probably emboldened by his relationship with my new supervisor, made my life a constant hell. When we were doing mock interviews for the job market, he volunteered to interview me. Multiple professors intervened, and he allegedly went around the department accusing me of slandering him. He showed up to my dissertation defense even though he was asked by multiple professors not to, glowered at me, grunted throughout, and then left in the middle. The worst came when I got a job offer at an excellent school (where I am now). I gave them--over the phone--my intent to accept, and asked them to send me a contract. At the same time, I emailed a school at which I was still under consideration to tell them of the offer. At that time, they told me I was first in line for their job as well. (Apparently, they made an offer to a woman, who, although originally accepting, had rescinded her acceptance. I emailed my supervisor and our university’s job placement committee chair to ask what to do. It was late at night, and I wanted to know if I should negotiate with the first school, and whether or not I could recommend my friend to the second school. Before I even had a chance to write back to the second school, my harasser had written to them about his own student. He had found out the search had reopened, and wrote to them that night. This was extremely embarrassing for me, because nobody but me knew the search was back open, and it was obvious that the information had come from me. It was also horrible that I didn't have the chance to tell school #2 that I was accepting another offer before he wrote to them on behalf of “our school”—so I was told—and for his student, whom they hadn't even interviewed. This was the last straw for me. I went, crying, to my supervisor's office, and then to the DGS, who told me that everyone knew my harasser was a sociopath, and that he wouldn't direct any more graduate students if he could help it. Nothing happened on this last point, of course. He is still directing graduate students.

I was called a ""mean girl"" for being confident and outgoing by female graduate students.

During the attack, I was called a ""bitch-ass cracker"" and ""faggot"" several times--both statements aimed at my gender and sexual identities.

Previously, it seemed this teacher taught regular summer workshops (every 2-3 years) at this school. After this occurred and we reported it, he wasn't asked back to teach there for another 10 years. I know this because he made the point to gloat to me about it. I have reported the harrassment I experienced twice to my institution (where we both teach now) and the first time the administration just seemed relieved that I was aware of the predator in my department. The second time I reported this I also was addressing his bullying and retaliation, and HR told me there was no retaliation, to not talk with anyone about this, and they did not investigate the report I filed about the original sexual harrassment incident.","It's complicated. Ironically, a few years after this occurred, I began working with him directly as a colleague. Then a few years into that teaching job I was promoted and I became his supervisor. Then a few years later, he began bullying me. The bullying began at about the same time I fully realized he had no sway on my career and never really did.

12/8/2017 19:56:51,"I had spent a fair amount of time (a couple of hours) speaking with the chair of a different department at a social event at a university faculty retreat. I had no sexual or romantic interest in him and I made that clear by verbally telling him so at one point in the evening when I felt he crossed a line when he stated that he and I both seemed to have unmet needs. He backed off immediately so I let it go, especially since I believe he had been intoxicated at the time. I am not one to hold a grudge so we became Facebook friends, and that friendship stayed well within what I felt were appropriate boundaries: no more unwelcome advances from him, just mundane liking and commenting on each other's posts, and some good-natured trash talk about sports. Then a few months later our Dean asked me to take on additional responsibilities regarding program level assessment within the college, since that is an interest of mine. In addition to having me advise [the dean] on assessment related matters, she also made me available to the chairs of all the departments in the college so that they could consult with me on implementing best practices for assessing student learning outcomes in their respective programs. The individual in question sent me a private Facebook message telling me that the dean ""gave"" me to him and said that that I have to do whatever he said, and he then suggested that we meet up at the airport Holiday Inn every Friday night to ""talk assessment."" This disturbed me quite a bit, but because I didn't want to make waves I chose to pretend I didn't understand his implication and answered him in earnest that I would be willing to meet in the library with other staff members to talk about assessing his program. He responded by saying that he actually had no interest in talking about assessment and really just wanted to hang out with me, and that regardless of my answer he would still write a favorable letter on my behalf for my upcoming third-year review. This last part was particularly upsetting, because while I knew that I had nothing to fear about my third year review, I felt intimidated and disgusted that he felt so free to imply that he had any authority over my third year review and would dare to link that to his holiday inn invitation. At that point I stopped responding and deleted him as a friend. About a week later he emailed me to say that he had all but forgotten that exchange but just realized that it might have rubbed me the wrong way and that if it did he apologized because he had been drinking, he didn't mean anything inappropriate, and that he hoped we could still be friends. I responded saying that I appreciated his apology, but that I did not feel comfortable interacting with him in any way beyond the most professional capacity. I also told him that I would give him the benefit of the doubt and that I would not be discussing the incident with human resources. I said that last part mostly to make it crystal clear to him that I would be well within my rights to do so, my hope being that he would consider the severity of his actions and resolve to refrain from behavior like that in the future with other colleagues.",My third year as assistant professor,Full professor at the University and chair of his department,Regional Teaching College,,Counseling,,I did not report,None,None that I know of,"None besides questioning myself and invalidating myself.

A fellow graduate student was working in the department's main research center (a title VI funded area studies center). He was always an arrogant, somewhat unpleasant, self-righteous type (and evangelical Christian no less, relevant because of the hypocrisy). One day the (female) director entered the center, a space always open to the public and students (both undergrad and grad), not at all a private office, and there was the grad student in question, on the clock supposed to be working, but instead masturbating to porn right there at his work computer in a public university office. The box of tissues he was careful to keep by the computer took on a whole new connotation, as did the crusty stains on the chair that other grad students were forced to sit in as well as they worked their shifts in the center. The director then found that the computer was filled with porn; it seemed that this is what he did for most of his 'working' hours. He was dismissed from his work-study job in the center BUT that's absolutely all that happened. No other form of rebuke or consequences at all. He continued in the program, continued to work with undergraduates, continued in his seminars with all of us, while several of his fellow graduate students continued to have to sit in the weirdly stained chair he left behind in the center. He took the rebuke so lightly, had so little shame, that he asked for his job back at the center the next year, apparently thinking that his perpetual masturbation in a public university office while on the clock really wasn't such a big deal. They didn't give him the job back, but that's the extent of negative consequence. He graduated and now holds a tenure track position at a different university. I see him at conferences regularly and often wonder, how does he interact with his undergraduates? And how is it that none of us thought to question whether this was a person who should be in a position of power vis-a-vis young vulnerable women? Or, rather, of course we questioned, but it never once occurred to us that we could do anything about it. After all, the administration knew already and did all but nothing. The fact that I'm still questioning, was this harassment? As if there should be any question that we all had a right to not be exposed to this guy's masturbation practices while at work, to not worry about seeing his erect penis while going about our work day, to not have to sit on the crusted remnants of semen he left behind....I write this and it sounds graphic, but in fact it's merely descriptive.

12/8/2017 16:14:59,"When I first entered my PhD Program, I heard a rumor from a female student that the (male) Dept chair had hit on another female student in the program and that I should be careful. Later that year, I was out at a bar with a group of doctoral students and a few faculty members following an end of semester holiday party,  and the Chair kissed an entirely different female doctoral student than the one he was rumored to have hit on right next to me. (I never discussed it with her). At a national conference university sponsored party, the chair introduced me to to his friend/colleague (notably another department chair at an elite institution), and then the other department chair acted very lewd and disgusting towards me in front of my Dept Chair. My Chair did nothing to intervene. ",doctoral student,My Department Chair,Other R1,,Social Sciences,,none that I know of,none that I know of,"I would say this was significant. This was my department chair, and funding decisions went through him and he was also influential in the field. So, after hearing that he hit on female students, seeing him kiss another female student at the bar in front of me, and realizing that he did nothing to protect me from his friend/colleague who was acting inappropriately towards me at a conference, I really kept my distance from him. And some other female doctoral students also felt awkward around him for similar reasons, and so didn't develop close relationships with him. And again and again, I saw male doctoral students who needed funding extensions secure it over female ones, even in cases where the female students had clearly out-produced our male counterparts. I think this was due in part to the fact that women in our program were scared to get too close to him, and so we were overlooked for opportunities. ",It didn't impact me mentally.,"It would have been really helpful to have my Chair in my corner as he was influential in the field. But, given the rumors and things I had witnessed,  I felt too uncomfortable around him and didn't become as close with him as I might have if the circumstances were different.

I was thinking, oh man he doesn't even realize that he is part of the problem. I don't think of my Chair as a predator, I think he believes that we are all consenting adults and is completely oblivious to how his behavior impacts female graduate students. He would never make the connection between how the culture he creates means women are not comfortable with him and then, because we feel we have to steer clear of him, face even more structural barriers to obtaining funding as our male counterparts happily head off with him to the bar after class to talk about their new research project.

12/8/2017 13:58:29,"When I was a first year graduate student, I started dating another student in my department who was a year ahead of me. The emotional abuse started early; assuming that I could not handle the problem sets on my own, he gave me all of his from the previous year. He constantly invalidated my feelings, suggesting each time I got upset that ""that's such a rich white girl thing to get upset over."" When I made comments during conversations, both one-on-one and in larger groups of physics grad students, he would frequently invalidate me, suggesting that I had seen nothing of the real world, and that I was nothing more than a wealthy sheltered child. 

Over time, he became increasingly controlling, and I feared retaliation when I wanted to end the relationship. I remained in that state for three and a half months. When I finally did, serious harassment ensued. He would drive by my house repeatedly, wait at the end of the bike path where he knew I liked to ride, and occasionally sit on my front steps and wait for me to get home at the end of the day. One day, he chased me out of the gym and screamed at me on the athletic quad. During departmental coffee hours and other social events, he would glare at me, shifting his position to maintain his line of sight. He texted me a death threat, and spread rumors in the department that I cheated on my problem sets and exams. He also circulated the rumor that I was only accepted into the program because of my gender identity, and that I only passed the first year because I am pretty. When I told my close friends about the harassment, many abandoned me, saying that it was my fault for breaking his heart. 

Since there were virtually no female faculty members in my department, and certainly none with whom I had ever conversed, I went to the administrative coordinator. She put me in touch with the Title IX office. The possible paths forward included an on campus no-contact order (which would not protect me in my off campus residence or neighborhood), or a full on restraining order. The Title IX office suggested that if I feared further retaliation, I should not press charges. I was extremely fearful of retaliation. For the remainder my my second year, I only went to campus to attend class.

12/8/2017 11:27:09,"June 2010 - At Workshop wrap party at offender's home.

While about half of party was in another room listening to someone play guitar, Prof. __  approached me while I was perusing his library and started up a discussion. There were other people around, but not involved in our conversation. He asked me if I was married for the second time that night (I am), then asked if I have children (I do, and I had brought my still-nursing baby with me to the conference, but she wasn't at the party).  I answered affirmatively to  both, and out of nowhere, he put his hand under my chin and leaned in to try to kiss me.  I immediately pulled away, shocked, and he grinned, then asked, ""Oh, was that not okay?"" I replied, ""no, it is most definitely not okay.""  I was flustered and embarrassed, and continued talking to him so as not to call attention to myself. Then he said he had ""something else to show me upstairs.""  I declined the offer and asked him to bring the book downstairs. 
He insisted, and went upstairs, telling me to follow. Instead, I looked for help. My advisor had left, but female Prof. who is a good friend of advisor and who I'd met for the first time at the workshop was still there. I asked her to come and look at  the films Prof. ___ had been showing me so I could ask her opinion of how to try to deflect/distract him.  From upstairs, we could hear Prof. ___  calling my name and saying that he had found what he was looking for and that I should come upstairs. I responded loudly from the staircase that I was with female Prof. and that he should bring whatever he had back downstairs, but he persisted. Even more embarrassed, and now sure that people could hear him, Female Prof. and I went upstairs together to find him in bed under the covers with his shirt off. Female Prof. shouted, ""We told you you couldn't do this anymore!"" Prof. ___, shocked, mumbled incoherently. I fled downstairs and found a senior student from my university, now a professor at a nearby elite university, and asked for her help and advice. She called a cab for me and told me to contact advisor immediately. 

Prof. _____ tries to approach me at any discipline event I attend, even though I have repeatedly told him I do not want him to talk to me. Most recently, he cornered me after 3 days of my successfully dodging him during conference in order to act chummy and force me to accept a copy of his most recent book. I repeatedly declined until it was starting to become a scene, then told him that it was clear he wasn't listening to me, didn't respect my wishes, and was going to do whatever he felt like, and I had no choice. I told him I would take it, but that I would immediately throw it away. He smiled, pulled it out of his LV bag along with a sharpie and asked, ""should I sign it for you?"" I said I didn't care. He was obviously going to do whatever he wanted. He signed it in the language of our area study, using the most familiar grammatical form to address me. A grammatical slap in the face. Another new acquaintance female Prof., to whom I told my story, expressed sympathy, but then indignation that she, as a friend of Prof. ___ had not been offered the book. She asked if she could have it. I told her that maybe he only gave his books to students he'd harassed and that she could take it out of the trash if she wanted it that badly. She did.

Our work was nearly identical and the answers the same;  this really confused me.).  

When I arrived in his office he motioned to a couch and asked me to sit down.  I thought he would sit in the chair at his desk.  He closed the door, locked it, and came and sat beside me.  He told me that he knew I was a ""smart girl"" and that I should not be earning a D.  He said that I could take care of the grade ""right now"" if I wanted to.

I said, ""I don't know what kind of person you think I am, but I'll take the D.""  

I then immediately went to my major adviser, and told him what happened.  I said I wanted to file a complaint.  He told me not to do it because I was going to be abroad the entirety of the following year and he was afraid that if I filed a complaint that the school would try to block me from going.  He said that I needed to trust him but the situation would be taken care of by the time I got back.  He also said that he didn't want to see me get ""blamed"" as a victim or to have my reputation tarnished as I would be dragged through the mud.  I was very upset but trusted him.  I went abroad.

12/7/2017 18:46:23,"Fall 2015, I started my PhD in a new program in the same college where I need received my masters. I was at an orientation get-together for new and current grad students at a local restaurant/bar. Only one prof showed up, but he was drunk, high, and disheveled when he showed up. I thought he was another grad student. 

I didn't chat much with him because I felt his presence, especially in the inebriated condition he was in, was inappropriate. It wasn't long before he made small talk, we discussed the upcoming semester, he assumed I was taking his philosophy course, but I hadn't told him I wasn't because I'd already had philosophy in my masters program. He asked how I felt about the program and I told him I thought I'd have a good time. He smirked, grabbed his beer, chuckled a bit, and said ""I'll make sure of it"" as he took a sip. 

I was so shocked, I sat there for 5 minutes trying to decide if I heard him correctly. My 14yo daughter was there so I got up and we left. The professor said ""see you in class"" and I told him I wouldn't be there. He was shocked and we left. 

I come from tech and am used to off-color comments, but for some reason, this threw me. After a few days I started taking to folks. One, a grad student who was friends with the prof tried to blow it off, ""he always says that, it is nothing!"" And I kept asking myself, and that student, since when does that excuse the behavior? 

Another grad student, male, described a situation where in the philosophy class I was not taking, he witnessed the prof being affectionate toward the female grad students, who happened to be primarily Asian. Then the Prof boasted of his sexual conquests with female Asian grad students in the past to my friend while walking to the bar for class (he held class in the local bars all the time). I was going to let his behavior toward me pass, 

I ended up calling a prof friend in my program and described this whole situation to her. She said they've had suspicion this was happening but no one willing to report it officially. So she suggested I go to the department chair and grad director. I did and they were very supportive and understanding, suggested I go to the Title IX office and file a complaint. It's worth noting that by this time i started feeling depressed.

I filed my report and the Title IX  office kept losing track of it's progress. Nearly six months later and they finally determined that the words the prof spoke we're harmless, he admitted to speaking them, and there was nothing to address other than to have a talk with him about how his words can be misinterpreted and require mandatory sexual harassment training as part of the grad school orientation program for this college. 

When the grad director for sat down with me to go over the report, he want nearly as supportive. Quite the opposite.

12/7/2017 18:41:42,"A series of events in which no particular event stands out as definitely crossing the line, but that when experienced together over time was extremely uncomfortable and confusing. I was an undergraduate and he was my professor, major advisor, honors thesis advisor, and one of my letter writers for my graduate school applications--so he had a ton of power and influence over me. It started when I was working with him on some research over the summer. Since it was summer, we met more often than we would have during the school year and the office where his building was located was even more deserted than normal. When we would meet, he would often sit next to me on the same side of the table rather than across the table or perpendicular to me. The door to his office was often closed. He sometimes offered me a coat or blanket to cover me up. This made me feel very uncomfortable because I was afraid he would try to touch me underneath the blanket. He once touched the hair on the back of my head when he was sitting next to me. He pressured me into going out to coffee or dinner with him three times that I can remember. On one occasion in particular he talked to me about how he had a crush on a professor when he was in undergrad. I don't remember the details, but that was described as a very positive experience and it very much felt like he was trying to draw a parallel between that relationship and ours. He often talked about his children but he never talked about his wife to the point that I remember thinking he must have been divorced. He was not. He once told me something like it's okay if other people thought he and I were dating because we had gone out to coffee and dinner. He pressured me into letting him visit me in my hometown. He did come to my house, but thankfully my parents were home. The rest of the visit was in public places. I remember hoping that this visit would be quick and painless but it ended up that he stayed for several hours. One day I finally got up the courage to stand up to him. I think I said something like I haven't always felt comfortable around you or something.

12/7/2017 18:39:45,"A now former chair and long time member of an art department (who is also an internationally known artist) consistently harassed and molested students and faculty within his department and in affiliated departments as well. He was most known for touching women without consent at the bar where he held his ""office hours"" and at department parties. The culture of the faculty and students in the associated departments revolved around whispering about the powerful professor's alleged actions. His reputation appeared to be decades in the making, and perhaps followed him from his previous teaching institutions. Though there are surely dozens of undisclosed cases that involve this individual, I am able to speak to two specific events that involved friends (fellow graduate students) and faculty members who are primary sources. In January of 2014, this individual molested two of of his graduate students at the bar during the first week of their second semesters in their graduate program. In both assaults, which occurred within an hour of each other and in public but hidden from view, he forced his hand into their pants and underwear, and in one instance repeatedly tried to grab the student's ,  When the incident was divulged to a senior faculty member and acting dean of students, a secret meeting was held with both of the students, the abusive faculty member, and the senior faculty, who proceeded to make list of rules that the abuser must follow as a resolution to the issue. The entire issue was swept under the rug and the abusive professor continued to teach for another year, advised students, sat on committees, and though his list of rules stipulated that office hours at the bar were no longer permitted, the abusive faculty member was unfazed and continued to regularly convene with students there. My friends, desperate to find justice, were advised to wait until they had solidified their degrees before reporting the incidents to the university. Neither of them shared any information about the abuse until Fall semester 2015, when one of them broke down after finding out that the abusive faculty member had When their degrees were signed in 2015 (one had to have her abuser's signature in order to graduate), they reported using proper channels. The HR representatives seemed as though they had been waiting for their statements, which led me to believe that they had been investigating the matter previously. After long and arduous plans were made by HR to file a university lawsuit against the professor using the accusations of my friends as a basis, the abusive professor was somehow allowed to disappear under the excuse of ""retirement"". He vanished from the department without a trace after decades of teaching and extreme influence. The case was dropped. No statements were made in regards to his sudden absence, though terrible misogynist rumors spread like wild fire amongst the departments, and his those who protected him before his removal became more adamant in their refusal to hear or admit to his indiscretions. I attended the initial HR meeting as a supportive shoulder for my friends, and my active participation in care, coupled with my vocal dissent of the abuser to other graduate students, landed me on a blacklist for my final year of my graduate program. Faculty members made evident their allegiances by committing conspiracy of secrecy after the abuser was ""vanished"" from the university. The majority of those who belonged to his camp- faculty who had once been friendly, cordial and actively engaged in my studies, including the chair of my committee, stopped speaking to me and refused to look me in the eye. During this period of growing disillusionment (with nearly every faculty member that I had worked with during my graduate career), I attended a spring semester (2016) gathering at the home of the then-Director of Graduate studies for the affiliate department in which I was a student.  While casually discussing interdepartmental politics, the subject of sexual harassment and the unexplained absence of the abusive professor was broached by the DGS. As I began to openly and explicitly explain the details of the January 2014 bar incident (the students involved had asked for the story to be discussed factually and publicly at the time), the DGS looked startled. She spoke in a hushed tone to myself and three other students, admitting that the abusive professor in question had molested her in exactly the same fashion (groping her vagina) during a faculty party when she first started teaching at the University in 2009. Her take away had been to diminish the action as negligible, detaching herself entirely, and continued to assert that instances of harassment or abuse would not be something that she would not let affect her career or her reputation. . I begged her to see why her non-action had led to years of continued abusive behavior, and specifically asked, ""If you had wanted to help a student in this situation, what would you do?"" Her response indicated that she seemed to find my concern for the wellbeing of students to be naive and overly sensitive. Though the specific incident of student abuse occurred almost four years ago, and the complaints/reports were made during 2014-2015, and the professor has been ""retired"" for a year of time, there has not been any kind form of formal or informal public address from the department, university, or community members regarding this situation. It seems as though too many people are implicated in the web of lies and feigning ignorance, and if one were to speak, all of those who protected the abuser would be outed.",I was in the first year of a three year graduate program. ,"He was the chair of an affiliated department, and I took a course with him during the semester that he assaulted my friends (T about the assault until the following fall semester).

12/7/2017 17:48:50,"This incident occurred during a thesis defense in a room full of about 100 people, including faculty, students, post-docs, and also the student’s colleagues, friends, and family members. Traditionally, upon graduation, the student’s thesis advisor will introduce the defending student prior to the research talk. I recently witnessed a graduating female student be introduced by her thesis advisor in the most inappropriate way. To provide a bit of background, a common technique in the field and that is commonly used in this particular lab is the use of light suction, typically applied by mouth into a pipette, to open and record currents in brain cells. His whole introduction of her revolved around how he knew she would be successful in his lab because she had an oral obsession. The slide he showed actually had a title along the lines of “orally obsessed” and showed photos of the student making sour expressions and playing a wind instrument. 

The entire room was detectably uncomfortable, people were visibly squirming in their chairs, uncomfortably laughing, and looking away.  The student ignored the introduction and gave one of the most thoughtful and comprehensive talks I have ever attended, which was her only option given that looking visibly shaken would have thrown her off balance. It is unfortunate, though, that the expectation was for her to remain poised and unmoved despite the clearly sexist introduction.  

What was most saddening was the fact that this person, who has just earned a doctoral degree in a STEM field, had her family, friends, and colleagues there to celebrate her PROFESSIONAL merits and her advisor introduces her in a sexist and deeply unprofessional way. After that I only spoke about the incident with female colleagues and classmates, but I wish there was a way that this issue could be addressed at an institutional level, with this type of behavior set as an example of what not to do. This is a tenured professor that is close to retirement, so people shrug it off as “this is just one person and the problem will disappear when he’s gone.” But this is an institutional problem and many men in positions of power think that as long as they are not raping someone, they are falling in line with the rules of professionalism.

12/7/2017 17:19:00,"In 2012 I was a postdoc and attended a national conference out of state. On the last day of the conference, at the conference dinner, I sat at a table of people I did not previously know. During dinner, I spoke at length with the man sitting next to me, who worked in a different area than I and who was at mid-career academic status. We talked about our research, our universities (we worked in the same state in different cities), and our families. As I often do, I mentioned my husband multiple times throughout our conversation-- partly because I like talking about him and I'm very proud of what he does but also to make it clear that I was married and not interested in talking to this person for any other reason than professional interest. This man also talked about his wife and family. I had no reason to suspect that our conversation was perceived by him as anything other than professional. After dinner, some colleagues that I knew were moving on with a group to a nearby bar, and this man I had been speaking with at dinner joined us to walk over. When we got to the bar, people ordered drinks then sat down at tables-- this man came and sat next to me, and many other colleagues were sat around the table. Shortly after we sat down, he discreetly moved his hand back to my rear end and began jamming his thumb between my buttocks. I was startled and jumped slightly, shocked that this was happening at all, especially in a crowded table full of academics. I reached my hand down and forcefully pushed his hand away. He then turned to me and said ""are you going to stay here"", and I said ""yes, I am"". He looked disappointed. He again touched my rear end and jammed his thumb between my buttocks. Again I pushed it away forcefully. At this stage he got up from the table. I was terrified and wanted to leave, but it would have meant walking back to my nearby hotel, and I was scared that he would follow me to my hotel. I looked around and realized that all of the colleagues in the room whom I knew well were male, and I didn't want to ask one of them to walk with me back to the hotel because I thought that would sound weird. I didn't feel I knew any of them well enough to tell them what had happened. I was scared. I leaned over to the woman (whom I did not know) across from me at the table and began engaging her in conversation about her research, hoping that the man had left, and I could wait a while then walk back to my hotel. Unfortunately, he came back with another drink and sat next to me. He discreetly tried to touch me on my rear end and jam his thumb up me a few more times. I pushed his hand away and kept talking to the woman across from me, trying not to pay him any attention. He got up and went to the bathroom, then came back, sat down one more time, and asked me again if I was going to stay there or if I wanted to leave. I said I was going to stay there. He looked visibly annoyed, and after another minute or so, got up, announced he was leaving, and walked out. My heart was racing. I still didn't want to leave on my own in case he was hanging around outside the bar. So I decided I would stay there and wait until some of the group that I knew headed back to the hotel where we were staying. I continued to try to engage in conversation with the people around me, but I was almost shaking with fear. I had never been assaulted like this before, and I was in shock that someone had tried to do this in a professional setting, in a crowded room full of colleagues. Eventually, people started to leave, and I walked back to my hotel with two male colleagues that I knew well, quickly locking myself into my hotel room to break down and cry. My flight was the next day, and I stayed in my hotel room until the last possible moment I needed to leave to go to the airport, terrified that I might see this man again. Once I was home, I broke down, hysterically crying, and explained to my husband what had happened. I felt so unsafe, so violated, and so discouraged for a long time. I purposefully avoided the city where the event took place for the next two years, avoiding going to any conferences or seminars there. The man didn't even live in that city or state, but I was traumatized by what had happened there. I received an email from the man about a week after the incident, sent to my institutional email address. He said that he had had too much to drink and he apologized for anything inappropriate that he said or did. I was disgusted even seeing an email from him, and immediately deleted it. I never told any of my academic colleagues about the incident. I was scared at the time that accusations might be made that it was inappropriate for us to be in a bar drinking, even though it was a group situation and I had started out the evening thinking everything was professional and above board. I didn't know what to do. I was scared people would not believe me or take me seriously. Also, he was at a different university, and the incident had occurred at an out of town conference. Even if I had wanted to report the incident, I didn't know if I should talk to my university, his, or the conference organization where the incident had taken place. About a year later, I did a university survey on bullying and sexual harassment in the workplace. I responded that yes, I had been sexually harassed, but I did not give any further details. The university did not follow up with me on my response. This is the first time I've recounted what happened at length. My heart is racing even now, 5 years later, as I write about it. I have never felt such helplessness as I did that night. And it has changed the way I interact with colleagues at academic conferences and in my academic workplace. I am wary of everyone, and I put up a wall so that conversations don't get too in depth about anything. That's a shame, because I'm probably missing out on some great opportunities to connect with new colleagues. It gets better with time, though, and I am slowly learning to trust again that I can have a professional conversation in a professional setting with a man in my profession without the possibility of being sexually assaulted.

It wasn't until later that I found out that he'd physically assaulted her in lab one night.  Some time later he found out that she told me and got nasty towards both of us.  I reported him to the department, but the adviser didn't take me seriously and encouraged all of us to sit down to talk it out as she thought it was just a misunderstanding.  When he found out I had reported him, he told the department adviser that he wanted to shut me up and that if this continued he'd ruin mine and my friend's career by going to our adviser. I asked for and was granted a university restraining order against him, to which he responded by getting a restraining order against me, claiming that I was out to get him.  Though the restraining order prohibits discussing circumstances with other members of the university who are not involved, he told my entire lab group some story about how I was a crazy person and making up stories to get him kicked out.  I only found out when one of my labmates stopped speaking to me and told me I should have kept my mouth shut.  I alerted the Title IX office as well as a university office that he was violating his terms of the order and retaliating against me for coming forward.  University office didn't do anything.  Title IX had a very intimidating and aggressive interview process for both me and my friend, who was scared about coming forward in the first place.  Title IX concluded that they thought he was crazy but that he wasn't going to do anything and was going to be out of the country for the next couple of months.  No action taken.

12/7/2017 15:23:41,"I was accepted to Duke University in January of 2014. I matriculated in the Fall of that year. I had previously completed a Masters degree in American history, the field I intended to pursue with [Removed], who would have been my advisor. Within the first few months of working together, it became apparent that Professor [Removed] was not comfortable with my research topic, or with me. I have epilepsy, which has primarily presented as petit mal seizures and is controlled by medication. The first indication I had that my working relationship with Professor [Removed] was not going well occurred in a phone conversation. She told me that I should jettison my M.A. thesis for a side project that I had created in matter of weeks. She became irritated when, confused, I asked a number of questions. “If you want to bring sexual violence back in,” she said, “do that. People write about it because it’s trendy.” I was horrified. After a long silence, she said, “You know I am joking.” “Yes” I said, “I know you are joking,” not really able to understand the exchange we were having. 

A few weeks later, I told her I needed to talk about doing primary source research in Georgia. I had, in essence, written two MA theses, one of which I had graduated with, and the other I offered as my admissions essay. Since Professor X did not approve of my research on sexual violence, I tried to bring our attention to my work on local courts in Western Georgia. If this work was to be the focus of my dissertation, however, I was going to need on-site access to court records. I would need to drive. Even if, in the course of our work together, we decided a working with a more centralized archive was preferable, I needed her to make an informed decision. So I told Professor X of my condition, and informed her that I cannot drive. I asked her advice, strictly in regard to research. She was hostile. She would not have a conversation, and repeatedly suggested that in fact, I could drive. It was not until at least three meeting later that I flatly told her “driving is off the table, it will not happen.” She told me that she had “grown up poor,” that no one had believed in her, and that I should therefore find a way to make my situation work. I reiterated that I could not, in fact, drive, that it is illegal for me to drive, and that I wanted nothing from her except advice on how to successfully research in my particular situation. As is procedure, I spoke with our Director of Graduate Studies (DGS), who largely belittled me.
In the spring, I was assigned (by the same DGS) to work as T.A. for a known harasser, [Removed]. This man sat next to me and sang songs about fraternity brothers impregnating sorority girls. He joked about an actress who was in a car accident, making comments about her breasts. On my first day in his class, when I (and my fellow T.A.) sat down, he said to the class “they sure look interesting, don’t they? But we will find out if they are. We will find out if they have anything to say.” He let (mostly male) students question my grades and my authority in the classroom to the point that I really was nothing more than his secretary. I complained, repeatedly. He was considered immovable.
I went through much of that first year in Grad school essentially without an advisor. I should note that, while students often do not formally declare an advisor until their second year, most do have informal relationships with Professors, and all receive the benefit of some kind of mentorship. I went without this for nearly all of my first year. Midway through the second semester of my first year, I took a course with Professor  Y [Removed], who agreed to become my advisor. This move entailed, however, a radical shift in focus, and with that, a huge amount of work. I changed my field from American history to European, and with the help of Professor Y, formulated a new research topic, specializing in 18th century France and the history of emotions. It began to look as though I was through the worst. Professor Y and I started to pull together a dissertation committee. My grades were flawless. I was genuinely interested in my new field. I missed my old work, and was still hurt and confused by Professor X's behaviour, but I wanted to move forward. Professor Y suggested that I enroll in Professor Z's  seminar, and ask him to serve on my committee. I did. This was a terrible mistake. After about four class sessions, Professor Z expelled me from his class. I was the only woman in the class. He sent everyone out of the room except me, came back in, and began an argument with me, much of which, unfortunately, I don’t remember. I do know that he told me “You don’t need to be here” and told me that he would withdraw me from his course. He also told me he would not be on my committee, a statement, that, while it seems obvious enough, is, in the context of a small department, intended to convey that he will be do his part to see that I do not progress toward graduation. The only explanations he offered were 1) that I typed too loudly and 2) I had paused too long before answering a question. I believe that my disclosure to Professor X influenced Professor Z’s behavior. Even if evidence of this is lacking, the fact that, by this point, most of the department was aware of my health status made it nearly impossible for me to complain about what was happening. I was a pariah.

I assumed, however, that the department would, at the very least, form a committee to investigate, or perhaps offer mediation. There was nothing. This is still the worst part of this situation to me. Absolutely no one, apart from my own advisor, cared about this in the least. It was a career-breaking move, and it was meant to be. The following fall, I enrolled in a required pedagogy course and (also required) methods course. Though I did well in both of these courses, I had to work harder than my peers, and was the subject of a good deal of mockery in my methods course. This was a direct result of the fact that 1) I had to change focus in yr. 1 and 2) I had been withdrawn from a course in yr. 2 and therefore been deprived of a research/writing opportunity. Therefore, in year 3, when I took our required grant writing/ portfolio preparation course, I was lagging behind my peers. The complaint here is that the department knew what had happened, knew they had not addressed it, knew that it was quantifiably slowing my progress to degree, and, nevertheless, placed the burden on me. They did this not only in the sense that they refused to change deadlines, there were also numerous subtle barbs in the classroom. For instance, when I offered my proposal for workshop, the professor,  Prof Q, mocked the use of French text, saying “Now you are just showing off” and encouraged other students to do the same. Perhaps it does not need to be said, but the dissertation is about France. This is common practice. The underlying assertion of Professor Q's statement is that I am too stupid to be doing the work I am doing, and something is out of joint.

Finally, I was pressured out because 1) it became clear that there would be no relenting on the timeline – it would remain the same, despite the fact that others had made mistakes, not me, and despite the fact that those errors had never been internally adjudicated. I was essentially forced to take a semester leave, because without it, I could not have passed Professor Q’s methods course. The reason I could not have passed it was that I needed a (pre-existing) research paper in order to do so. My peers didn’t have this problem, but Professor Z had thrown me out the course where I would have written this paper. So, in order to avoid an F on my record, I gave up a semester worth of funding. 2) My advisor let me know that the department had little to no intention of funding me any longer than they were contractually obligated to. That time was coming soon. He said, and I believed, that my work was very good, and could be funded. There is limited funding for French historians, however, and it is even more limited for those historians in the early stages of their careers. My choices were: a) fund myself for a while until that eventuality, and then let Duke take credit for my work or b) save the money and emotional effort. I chose b, but it cost me a lot of pain.

12/7/2017 8:06:29,"During my Masters I was required to program an experiment using Matlab. I had no experience with this whatsoever and very little time in which to write the code, but my supervisor insisted that it had to be done this way (I was hoping to have him as my advisor for the PhD program the following year so I wanted to impress him). 

I was approached by a PhD student who had offered to help me write the code, in exchange for authorship on a future paper that would arise from the project. I agreed, and we also negotiated payment from my supervisor to write the code. It started out well, with the student assuring me that he could write the code in one week. However, he then began requesting that I sit with him whilst he put the code together. I desperately needed the code so I could conduct my research work (which formed my dissertation project for the year), so I would come in and sit with him (sometimes this would be in the middle of the night as he said he could only code then). During this time, he would make lots of sexually explicit comments about me, which I laughed off and ignored in the hopes that he would finish the coding. He would then guilt me into going for drinks with him at the end of the day, and threaten to stop writing the code unless I went with him. I went along with this, trying to act professionally in the hopes that he would just do the work. This ended up going on for the best part of 2 months, which was absolutely emotionally exhausting. 

Eventually, I had enough of his behaviour and began to hint at him that I was in a relationship in the hopes that the inappropriate comments would stop. This led to him berating me for ""leading him on"" and suggested that I let everyone know about my relationship status when I first meet them so that I don't confuse people in the future. He then started to belittle me in the lab in front of other (male) researchers and suggested that I was too emotional to be a scientist/shouldn't bother because as a female I would never be as good as my male colleagues. He then continued to harass me for about 6 months, showing up randomly at my house/my office/events I was attending. Eventually I had to finish writing my thesis at home to avoid him. 

My colleagues suggested that I should make a formal complaint against the student, but as a masters student I didn't feel like I had the authority to make such a complaint and was worried about how it would make me look.

12/7/2017 8:02:21,"A male colleague, another graduate student in my department, had apparently been talking to others in the department about his fantasies concerning me and his girlfriend. I am gay and was open about it. On a class field trip that required a stay of several nights in a hotel he was put in charge of making hotel reservations. He attempted to manipulate the hotel rooms so that it would put me in the same room as his girlfriend where I guess he thought we would inevitably act out his fantasies. No one told me about any of this until we were in the airport about to leave for the trip. His girlfriend ultimately did not come on the trip because he assaulted her and her advisor pulled her out of the trip. The previous year he had assaulted another grad student he was dating. He had also followed another female graduate student around a party trying to show her his penis.

A few minor incidents - being warned away from working with a certain professor at another university because of his behavior with younger women. Numerous rumors, or more like open secrets, about important professors and directors of institutions and their younger female students. Gay male friends have told me about being propositioned by older male professors.",Graduate student,Graduate student the year below me,Elite Institution/Ivy League,,,,"Based on the response of the university to previous incidents I did not report the issues directly involving me, although I did end up giving evidence after he ignored the restraining order against another student (see below). The two violent assaults did not receive much response from the university. For the penis/party incident there was new staff at the relevant office and he was given a university-imposed restraining order to maintain distance from that student, which he completely ignored. She made a further complaint and the results of this were never disclosed to me. His advisor (also my advisor) supported him throughout, but then he had always had a better report with the male students anyway and once made a comment about how all the women in the discipline were some sort of nasty cadre. ",Had a temporary university-imposed restraining order against one colleague. Lost a few friends. ,My relationship with my advisor was always difficult. I suppose I just learned I could rely on him even less than I thought. I more or less left campus after this and had only sporadic contact with him via email (also true today now that I am out of grad school and employed - I just bother him for the occasional reference letter.) I avoid the harasser and we don't speak. I've skipped a few events or not talked to various professors and such because he was already there talking to him. ,"Further added to the stress of my graduate studies and general depression I was already struggling with. I withdrew socially almost completely from my department as I had learned that everyone had been talking about the gossip concerning me without actually telling me that there was a colleague I should be wary of, and I didn't think I could trust anyone there at all.","Ultimately fairly minimal, but only because I chose to pursue work in another country anyway. Otherwise I would probably have to deal with him and my advisor a lot more. ","I wish I could tell people about this incident without sounding crazy or vindictive. He's a sexual harassment lawsuit waiting to happen and a liability to every institution he's affiliated with. Professors who know about and condemn his behavior still write him letters of recommendation. He knows how to please people in power and pal around with all the older male professors, so I think it's only a matter of time before he is in the position to do real damage to younger women in the field.

He said he'd be available to answer more of my questions and invited me to meet him for a drink later (which I perceived as a great honor!). Since the conference was taking place at a hotel, I later met him on the main floor in the restaurant. After shaking his hand he invited me up to his room to talk (which I thought was really strange) and I declined, saying that the restaurant was fine. He resisted saying ""oh it's so loud down here"" (It wasn't), and again, I said I preferred to stay there. He looked disgruntled and said OK and we sat down. SO I started asking him questions about his research, and he finally interrupted me and said ""Look I'm old and my ears don't work like yours. Lets just go talk in my room. Just talking....Look, I'm married and have kids! I'm not going to bite! It's just quieter up there."" At this point I felt bad...like why was I making such a big deal about it.

We get into his room, and I sat right down in a chair next to the window. He sat across from me. He then said ""This is better. Now, tell me about your childhood"" (Why he asked that...I'm not sure). So I started telling him my history of diagnosis, etc... and then he asked to take my pulse. I gave him my wrist and he held it, starting to run his fingers on my skin. I jolted my arm back, stated ""I need to go"", got up, and walked to the door. He started saying ""What...why are you leaving? Don't you want to stay""? I opened the door to leave, and he said ""Well at least give me a hug"". When he hugged me he started kissing my neck.

12/7/2017 6:29:25,"I have three instances to report. I was a clinical social worker in health care at a top university in Canada. I did individual, partner , family and group counselling. I was considered a leader in my field of end of life care. The first incident was with a surgeon I worked with. After 2 years of powerful work with clients and their families, my colleague, a married man with several adult children, asked me to meet him for lunch and said he would ""no longer take no for an answer"". He had never asked me for lunch before nor been anything but professional in his behaviour. That should have been my first clue that he felt I was part of his secret life. We went to lunch and I have to say my concern was for his health and well being. I thought he was struggling with something and needed a compassionate ear. At lunch he proposed to me that he buy me : a hospice building and licensing so we could continue to do this work of end of life care. He also offered to pay all the hospice expenses, buy me a condo , a car, and anything else I needed. I was shocked. I asked what he would expect in return for all this generosity and he said :""only that you make yourself available 24/7 to speak to me"". I had been a model in my younger years and was quite familiar with the world of what men and women can get themselves into without occupational boundaries. I was single at the time, having left my husband. I said : ""what if I am with someone and you call to talk"". He said :""you will ask them to leave"". I told him that I was flattered by his wish to access my mind at such an expense to him but that even though he was offering me everything I needed, I was a woman who needed her own independence and so could not agree to this. He then refused to work with me, went to the organizations CEO and tried to discredit me. I was taken off this cancer service and placed in another service , less enjoyable to me. I felt threatened and at risk. I was told by my supervisor to stay in my office and become the best clinician I could become. Security was notified. The surgeon then began an anonymous letter campaign to threaten the surgeon who headed the service i worked on. The surgeon who began this was eventually let go but I had experienced violence and intimidation and coercion in the workplace. I was strong enough to say no but suffered occupational harassment, personal threat, sidetracking of my career and I felt a sense of public shaming by his rife comments when I passed him in the hall.

The second incident was a senior neurologist at the university I worked at. He was seeing me as my physician in a dr-patient relationship. I saw him over years. I choose to switch my care from him to another physician when he began to make suggestions that I was sexualizing the relationship ( I have severe pain from a motor vehicle accident and was seeking his opinion on this. it is hard to sexualize anything when you have that level of pain). I was shocked by this, and simply left after an incident where I felt he had said something to his secretary about me that was sexualizing of me as patient. Some ten years later, after I left, he was brought up on charges of sexual harrassment by another client, and these charges resulted in his being fined and having him retire. I think I was witness to this old man loosing his filters....and it went on for some time before someone else called him on it.

The third incident is another misuse of power by men. My medical director in end of life care wanted me to support his efforts to bring in a change in policy at a federal level for end of life care. I beleive in the right to your own ideas and freedom of speech in my academic world. I told him I could not support him. I was then head hunted to an international agency in oncology and palliative care in Europe. It was a think tank for cancer care. Upon my return from meeting with the UN about pain managment being a human right, and meeting with this think tank in Switzerland, my elite program on family care was collapsed by this physician-because I would not do as he asked. 

My program was income generating and a top clinical program. He was trying to silence my voice as its leadership was well recognized. He was a physician and a medical director. I was a director of a psycho-social-spiritual team or family therapy team. We were both top notch players-but I had the international reputation more than he did. 

He collapsed my program, fired my team, kept on those he could control , hired some of my students who would end up leaving for the same reason I did ( his determining of their practice). What was most interesting was that he asked me to write a paper for publication. I did and heard nothing back. I then asked about it and he said he had lost the paper. 10 years after I wrote that paper, 5 years after I left him employment, one of my medical students ( graduate level) found a published curriculum which gave me second authorship. The first authorship was his. He had taken my paper and published it under his name. I would never have found it unless my student brought it to my attention. 

All three men, tried to cull my career and use/misuse my presence and abilities. ",Assistant Professor moving to Associate Professor.,"Doctors : surgical oncologist, neurologist ( top neurologist), family physician",Elite Institution/Ivy League,,"Social work, theologian ",,"In the first case, I was moved to another service, protected but very much felt 
an attempt to discredit me personally ( they could not do this professionally) . The incident was viewed as a personal issue when it was not. It was oppression, sexual oppression.

Second case, I did not complain but in retrospect i should have said something so others would not be hurt. I did not speak out because the neurologist was the best in his field and I felt it was me who was inspiring his interest as I felt he had heard ( misheard) about the (non-) relationship with the surgeon . Both worked in the same institution. Even if the first incident/case/episode had been real and mutual, it would not have and should not have led to an assumption by the second physician that i would be open to turning my need for health care into a sexual relationship.

Third case, it took a lot of work. MY work was severed and I received a package from my employer at the hospital. I was retained by the University but I did not receive my Associate professorship as all the documentation for this process was thrown out by the Medical Director. I had no recourse and no fight left in me to pursue this. I continue to work with the University. 

I took the surgeon to the College of Physicians and Surgeons who usually only hear complaints from consumers. I knew the physician in this third case was unwell as I used to sit with him in the emergency department when he was brought in by ambulance after an episdoe of wandering. After his insistence that I support legislation and policies I did not feel I could support, I identified my concerns about his judgment and use of power. He was removed from his Medical Directorship but placed in a key position in a center for ethics. My concern about his behaviour had gone to this centre in writing. I feel he went there to destroy any evidence of my concerns. I do not know this for a fact...but I hypothesize this. It took me 10 years but I got first authorship on the curriculum published by the DFCM at the university. This physician would die a few years after the original incident. I think I lost close to $500,000 .00 in salary as I never found the strength to place myself back into a top level job because of the co-ercision I experienced from these 3 physicians.  I went on to be purposeful and a leader in my field-but suffered deeply for their behaviours and solicitations and mis use of power.","The first case, the surgeon , was fired but allowed to continue with his work. He has since died.
The second case, the neurologist, practiced until someone took exception to his behaviour and filed a complaint and won with the College of Physicians and Surgeons. He is now retired as a result of the successful complaint. 
The third case, the physician was promoted, then died.No discreditation or repremend.","Significant loss of income and status, demoralization, hesitation to continue building my career in such a sexually harrassing and controlling environment as the ""Boyz club"".","I am sure it has taken its toll-but two of the physicians are dead and I am still alive. I did have two strokes during this time ( 2001,2005) and I would say this had an impact on my longevity. I am 66 years of age now, still working , partially by choice but partially because I have to as my career trajectory went sideways because of these situations cited and I want to continue to maintain my own lifestyle so small amounts of work help.",Quality of life changed dramatically with loss of income ( I was very well paid). Stress in the family. Strokes effected me deeply.,"I am not wanting to give you my name and my institution as I am a public figure and still continue to teach-but mostly because these incidents left me with such a level of distress I am concerned any further opening of this will cause me another stroke.This is a real consequence for me. 

 I hope you can use this information . I am not a victim-I stood strong in these scenarios-but I would have rather put the effort into helping others than protect and defend myself. 

In my day, at the Jewish Hospital I worked at ( I was not Jewish) the men would say that non-Jewish women were the women you ""practiced on"" before you went home to your wife and had great sex with her. It was in this climate I worked and all three men were Jewish by culture and religion. I was shocked by the pervasive sexualization in the first two cases....and the misuse of gender and power in the third. I hope you will understand I have had enough of living in this soup of deception that was created by the men involved. I hope your work brings change for the next generation. I am so proud of your call for people to speak.

12/7/2017 6:01:55,"As the first and only tenure-track faculty of color to be hired by my ex-department, I experienced racism, sexism and prejudice based on national origin for eight years. In particular, from September 2014 onwards, the former chair, a popular and influential personality on campus, engaged habitually in inappropriate, predatory and disrespectful conduct. During this time, I received numerous emails (even during my summer breaks in India), text messages and voice mails asking me to join him for either lunch, coffee or go kayaking with him. Once he had unexpectedly entered my lecture room, minutes before class was to begin, and asked me out for drinks; another time he wanted to go grocery shopping for me. Over the years, I endured his 'bad behavior' that included being intimidated by him twice on the road to work, and being pointedly informed by him that his brother was a parole officer. He also delayed the publication of my monograph, contracted with one of the leading international publishers in my field. The times we did go for lunch, they felt like dates more than meetings. He would also make flirty, suggestive comments; stare at certain parts of my body; and manspread in his office.","It started when I was officially untenured, but knew it was coming through, through tenure in 2015 and till my resignation in June 2017.",Chair of my department ,Other Type of School,University of North Carolina Wilmington,Film Studies,,"Incredulity, derision, condescension at even an informal complaint.

12/7/2017 5:37:24,"While I was a PhD student, my advisor and I were planning to go to a conference. He wanted to book one room, but I felt very uncomfortable. This made him very angry - because there were budget restrictions. Instead he invited another female student to stay with him, she accepted. When we got back from the conference there was a shift in the dynamic that was I was too naive to understand. Effectively this PhD student was allowed to bully me and slowly their influence over the lab grew. My ideas were taken away from me, and given to other students. I was laughed at in lab meetings and my work was largely ignored. In 2008, I took a research internship at Harvard University (I applied largely to get away from my own lab) but this must have elicited some jealousy because the day after this internship was confirmed, I was suddenly accused of data falsification by my advisor. He didn't approach me, he went straight to the dean of Research. My PhD was put on hold while I underwent a 10 month investigation. There was no basis to his claim, and afterwards I was fully exonerated. Turns out the university was also investigating my advisor at the same time for a potential affair with his other student. When the university questioned him - he initially lied, to keep her as a student. But half way through the investigation into the veracity of my work, he left his wife and proposed to his other PhD student. They married later that year. While under investigation he took it upon himself to tell everyone at my university that I had falsified data. To this day I think my reputation in my home country is questioned. When I finally wrote a formal complaint about the way I was treated during my PhD, my university discovered that he had ""unofficially"" been strongly advised to leave his previous position (as an assistant professor at another university) because he had a reputation for sleeping with his students and had subsequently accused 2 of them of falsification.

Both of my PhD supervisors were serial harassers of female students.  They were particularly aggressive toward the cohorts of young master’s students who cycled through the department each year and therefore were most likely to (a.) not be aware of previous histories, and (b.) try to simply tolerate or avoid the harassment as best as they could because they knew they would only be in the department for the one-year program (although I have little doubt these experiences in some cases terminated thoughts some of them might have had of continuing for a PhD in my department). As a male student who witnessed some incidents and had others confided to me, not all of these stories are mine to tell.  However, I will say that none of this behavior was remotely secret.  My advisors boasted openly about their constant pursuit of students and deliberately spread rumors about students they wanted to sleep with, were sleeping with, or had been unable to sleep with (the latter category of course being on the receiving end of some of the worst rumors).  They also boasted about having helped particularly fabulous looking students gain admission to the department, presumably meaning that students merely gifted with brains rather than with my advisors’ standards of youth and beauty would not have received such preferential treatment.  And of course since physical appearance and perceived pliability were the only attributes my advisors valued in women, they were loud and noxious misogynists when it came to speaking about the intellectual capabilities of female scholars.  No matter what superficially charming façade they might occasionally put on in mixed company, when they were among fellow white males (naturally they were bigots, too), any female scholar was deemed simply incapable, weak-minded, and unfit, regardless of whether she were a student or a Max Planck Institute director.  It was this level of presumption that all males must feel the same way and so there was no need to hide their behavior or beliefs among comrades that was probably a factor in the viciousness against me after I spoke up.  They simply could not believe that a fellow male would be so traitorous as to object to their actions – after all, they had never harassed me personally – never mind that someone would be insane enough to act in a way so obviously and terminally detrimental to my own career prospects in academia.

Apart from what I witnessed in my own department, I’ll just add a short note regarding my experiences in a non-academic career track after I finished my PhD. I am not an especially gregarious individual, and yet the number of times I have had professional women outside the academy confide to me their assault experiences during graduate study is both stunning and more than a little horrifying in view of how much of an undercount it must represent compared to the number of women who were understandably never inclined to share some of their worst life experiences with a random male colleague.  It must therefore always, ALWAYS be remembered that any sampling of sexual harassment and assault experiences within the academy is necessarily going to underestimate the scale of the problem because it will invariably under-sample women who left academia in part or entirely because of harassment.
",PhD student,"Both of my PhD supervisors held the rank of Senior Lecturer, which is roughly the British equivalent of an Associate Professor in the U.S.",Other R1,,History,,"My department chair angrily told me that he was already aware of female student complaints but of course wasn’t going to do anything about it.  He then declared I would no longer have the right to any PhD supervisor at all if I didn’t want to work with the serial harassers who were my assigned supervisors.  Presumably he thought this would be enough to keep me from finishing my dissertation (and since the department had already cashed the last of my external fellowship checks at this point, they were A-OK with that).  However, I fled the country, wrote up my dissertation from another institutional base, and then demanded to submit the dissertation for examination by an external committee, which was standard procedure under the British system where my department was.  At this point, the department chair tried to have himself reassigned as my official supervisor and thereby run out the clock on my university registration, despite the fact that his background was utterly irrelevant to my research and indeed farther away than any other member of the entire department.  One of my ex-supervisors suggested some of his drinking buddies as members of the dissertation examination committee.  Etc.  Etc.  Etc.  It was ugly.  Ultimately, I gained the right to submit my dissertation to an impartial examination committee and was passed for the PhD, and at this point I left academia and accepted a non-academic job.",Promotion.  Obviously.  Both of my ex-supervisors were rapidly promoted to the rank of full professor – a bigger deal under the British system than the American – and the department chair now has his own new department at another elite school.,I left academia and have had a varied career track including a short period in diplomatic service (where my first assigned mentor boasted of having given women higher scores on the Foreign Service oral exam if he liked their legs).,"Yeah, it’s hard.  I’m obviously extremely fortunate in that I never experienced any of the harassment or assault directly to myself and instead was only retaliated against in a non-physical manner for speaking out on behalf of others.  I never forget that this is by far the easier consequence.  Nevertheless, especially lately with harassment finally beginning to be taken more seriously and so many stories constantly in the news, it is really difficult to focus on work sometimes without spiraling into a whirlwind of old emotions.  It’s not helped by the fact that I recently started working again on research related to my old dissertation topic, and however much I may intellectually like the subject, it is still bound up with these ugly experiences from the past.  You never stop wondering if there was a different way of speaking up that might have been more successful at having an impact rather than just leading to you getting swatted aside like a meaningless insect.  Partly there is the question of what an alternative career outcome might have looked like, but these days I mostly wonder what my failure to actually take these assholes down fifteen years ago means for countless women they have encountered since then.  Shit, I’m tearing up even as I write this.","In the last 22 years of academic study and professional work, I have had a total of one two-and-a-half year job, one three-month fellowship, and one six-month fellowship that did not involve at least one of my superiors being at some level a harasser or embezzler. Even in the very rare cases where I can genuinely say that my outspokenness did contribute to a modest degree of change, it only happened after I had been successfully squashed and driven out, at which point changes were quietly implemented later.  At this point, I am unemployed and emotionally beaten down by the experiences of the past couple of decades but extraordinarily lucky to have a wife with a successful career and therefore to have the opportunity to take a bit of a respite from the workplace.  Can I just make one request to those of you continuing academics, though?  I know you’re all terribly busy (contrary to the plethora of shallow hack jobs and opinion pieces in the press) and that you get a lot of random queries from random people.  Nevertheless, sometimes that “independent scholar” who writes to you with a quick question or solicitation for advice is only an independent scholar because they once took it hard on the chin in an effort to make your own workplace a bit safer.

His class lectures frequently revolved around sex, which was unusual for a class in Christian Church History. He would say inappropriate things to the female students. One day he asked about what we think when a ‘hunk’ walks by. He would also make objectifying statements about women. When I complained about it he would tell me that some feminist theologians think that we need to be talking about push up bras and sexuality. He never respected me as a theologian and made clear his amusement of me, particularly when a male classmate made a disparaging remark towards me.

He was really intimidating when he said that he ""perceived"" I was attracted to him, so I had no idea what to say in order to explain him I was not attracted to him without making him angry. I though that if I let it go and forget about it, he was also going to forget it. But the next week he ask me to go to his office to talk about my PhD admission and my PhD project. He actually didn't wanted to talk about that, he just made me sit on his lap and kissed me. I was really confused and I though that I had no choice but to ""follow the game"" becase asking him to stop behaving like that could cause me troubles with him. Of course, I didn't want troubles with him, he was not only going to be my PhD supervisor but he was also the Academic Secretary of our department (the most powerful guy after the director of the department). Shortly after that he said we should go for a coffee but he took me to his house. There he sexually abused of me; after that he said we were on a relationship and we should see each other more frequently. Again, I thought I had no choice, I though that if I said no, my academic career would be over because he was a very powerful guy, one of the most powerful ones in our department. So I agreed and we saw each other for a month and a half. This ""dates"" were on weekends and took place at his house, so basically the ""date"" was just taking me to his house to be sexually abused. After a month and a half, I was completely traumatized, I told him I couldn't bear any more and I wanted to end the ""relationship"". He was really rude, he didn't take it well. I tried to get a new thesis supervisor before the beginning of my PhD, but ""mysteriously"" nobody in the department wanted to work with me, they said the best person to supervise my dissertation was him.  So the first 18 months of my PhD I suffered his revenge because he devoted all his energy and power to make my life miserable, I suffered psychological abuse from him and I perceived rejection from many professors from our department. Besides, he wasn't doing his job as my thesis supervisor. I told him I needed a change of thesis supervisor because there was no significant progress on my PhD investigation. He got very angry and he said he was going to use all his power to prevent a supervisor change. I was lucky enough to find support in a female professor, who fought for me and helped me to find a new PhD supervisor.         ","I had finished my Master's degree when he raped me, but the psychological abuse continued during my first year as a PhD student.

12/6/2017 19:10:12,"I was a visiting PhD fellow at the CUNY Graduate Centre in NYC in 2007 taking a number of courses with their preeminent elderly white male professor of Marxist Geography. As a mature student, an out lesbian of colour and a longstanding political activist I largely kept my distance from the social life of bars that was the cultural life of the largely white male marxists in the department. After two months of interesting course work I decided to attend a departmental event, reception and after-social at the pub. My professor suggested we sit at the bar away from the departmental crowd to have a chance to talk. Amidst an interesting political and intellectual exchange, a few drinks and laughs I turned to  get something from my bag - when I turned back to the table he was suddenly right on me and without a word, question or notice started to french kiss me.  I was stunned and picked him up by the shoulders and lifted him off me... asked him where his coat was - he said upstairs... I told him he was going to get his coat, while I was gathered up my stuff and left the bar - without him - to head home. I was in shock and literally ran out of the bar to the subway back to Brooklyn as fast as I could. ",A visiting student at the department of Anthropology,He was the Professor of three classes I was taking that term and the highest profile academic at the CUNY Grad Centre,Other Type of School,CUNY Graduate Centre,Anthropology - Marxist Geography,,"After much hand wringing as a long-standing activist on violence on women I decided I could not afford the consequences of taking on the most high profile academic in my field as a mature PhD student with entering the field in my fifties. As a lesbian of colour who wanted to be known for my own work not for taking down the top white male marxist in the field. Therefore I did not launch any official bureaucratic action but settled on a ""whisper campaign"" in which I would tell my feminist, progressive and racialized colleagues. I therefore told the head of the department, other women professors in the department and the field - many of whom were very angry and supportive, but said they could do nothing without me making a formal complaint. I discovered from a fellow student that many women students, particularly students of colour, had left the department as a result of persistent sexual harassment by the most high profile white male professors in the department. Another visiting fellow told me in confidence that the two highest profile white men in the department would openly compete with each other over which women students were in their ""stable."" A feminist professor told me my dark curly hair and brown skin were favoured by my harasser. Another fellow student said her sister who is a lesbian was also sexually propositioned by this same professor at an AAG conference. ",None materially... in spite of my sharing with high profile colleagues ,"I was surprised by the depth of the negative effects of this incident, how much it undermined my health, my work, and became an effective brake on my otherwise solid professional momentum.

Overall the incident lengthened my PhD work by at least six to seven years and caused so much stress and distress that I ended up with an autoimmune disease along with persistent depression and isolation in my academic field.,Thanks for doing this - your work on this is much appreciated.

12/6/2017 19:09:35,"(I'll give you one of a long list of occurrences I have experienced.) Over the course of a few years, I endured a string of harassing incidents from a more senior colleague, from being labelled ""the feminist"" to being called a ""psycho feminazi wench"" (in an email, no less). He tried to ""give me a birthday kiss"" in the photocopy room, in front of another male colleague. He hit on me at a college function in front of a group of male students and at another function in front of colleagues. After the incident in front of male students, I a wrote a complaint. It was handled internally.   
Following my complaint, he proceeded to slander me to my colleagues and any staff member who would listen. When a new President took office, he managed to get his ear and actively tried to tank my tenure bid. My tenure was delayed a year and almost derailed. I had received 4 letters of support for tenure from external evaluators. I had published a book and several articles. I had excellent (empirically validated) student evaluations, and had been a non-tenured President of my national scholarly society. After the year delay, the Dean told me he was going to recommend I not receive tenure. I told him I had a labour lawyer. And was not averse to putting their faces on the front page of the local paper. ","I was a contract instructor/tenure track. 
","He was tenure-track/tenured. 
",Small Liberal Arts College,,Theology,,"Verbal intervention. Possibly a letter in his file. 
","None. He is now up for Full Professor. 
","I have spent the last 5 years fighting for my tenure, trying to write, trying to stay invested in my teaching, trying to research. I have been bullied about my field of study (""too narrow,"" ""too focused on women,"" ""not theological enough,"" ""too feminist"") to the point where I live with a type of PTSD about my work. I have been disparaged among the staff of the College and some of this has gotten to students. All because I rejected the advances of a sexist, misogynist colleague. ","I float in and out of depression and anxiety, for which I am medicated, and I have chronic stress headaches. I am in therapy and trying to sort through it all. 
","I'm back in the classroom after a full year sabbatical following tenure (I guess they didn't want to fight a legal battle they knew they would lose). I spent a good bit of my time reflecting on the strength required to stay in the academy and the shame associated with taking all those years of shit. I came a bit late to my career and I need the financial stability my academic life affords me, so leaving at this point feels precarious. But if I could find something I'd love as much, with the kind of stability my current position offers me, I'd leave. The book I write as I leave academic life will be an account of all the shit women face not only in the academy but more specifically in my discipline. This scenario is one of many different incidents of harassment (sexual and otherwise) I've faced as a scholar. I have some amazing colleagues (male and female) and some total dough heads.

We were all lecturers at a private, quite exclusive university. I was one of 2 women working with 8 men. One man had a very ""one of the lads"" way of interacting with the other men.  With myself and the other woman, he chose not to interact at all. We were invisible (which, because of his attitude and aggressive nature, was fine by us.) He would bicycle into work each day, and strip down to only his underpants, wipe his armpits and chest with a towel, and change into his work clothes for the day in his cubical area. Remember, this is an open-concept office, the cubical was just 2 low moveable walls, no door. We were all witness to his morning habits. I asked him twice to please change in the side-office, the one we used for consultations with students during work hours. He refused, stating that we were all adults, and in any case, I was married and familiar with the male human body. I had to resort to telling the head of our group, who in turn asked my co-worker to stop it. His response? He confronted me, and said I was upsetting the harmony in the office. I wish my male co-workers had stepped in as well. I'm not angry that they didn't. However I'm certain their input would have yielded better results.

The experiences was more like a small cult operating on campus. There was this one guy who used to be a Masters Student at the UofA back in the 1980's, but it did not work out so he  runs a mailing/Copy store on campus. He is still very much connected to Academia because it was my friend who is PhD' student at the time that introduced me to him. At first he appeared to be all father figure and loving, and at the time I was searching for a fatherly influence in my life because mine had died, I was searching for God and trying to find my way into this world. I was lost. So he took me under his wing, until a year later he started performing sex acts on me in the name of religion. When I would fight back and say stop, he would fight me back and tell me all sorts of things that were wrong with me, and thats when the brainwashing happened. He had me convinced that I was sick and needed his sexual touching to ""heal"" me, and everyone who operated in that inner circle took his side and demonized me. So I followed the crowed because I was being bullied, and they had me convinced I was spiritually damaged. There were times when I was in the back of his store- naked. Him molesting me. I wanted to scream and run out, but all I could think about was the shame and humiliation and dishonour this would bring to my family, and all the pain it would cause my siblings.There were so many people waiting in the store, and I could not do anything.

By this time I had also met professors who were just like him who claimed to have all this power and could mentor me. Instead I was financially, emotionally, psychologically abused and it was so deep and bad that even I had reported it, I would have been laughed at.  By than it was too late as well, I was 29 years old, and one would take my case seriously.

12/6/2017 14:21:15,"I entered into what I thought was a consensual relationship with a same-aged colleague during my postdoc. Our relationship lasted two years. We were in different labs but with overlapping research, which became more similar while we were together (and while we discussed our ideas). He was gaslighting me the whole time. While we were still sleeping together, he began writing a paper that specifically and viciously, by name, targeted my ideas. It was published in a journal on whose editorial board he (and his PhD advisor) were members. He thanked me in the acknowledgements (misspelling my name). I did not know until shortly before his paper came out, and would not have shared any of my ideas, unpublished manuscripts or grants, if I had known. I would never have consented to sex (or even friendship) if I had known about his paper. Although I thought our sex was consensual, he knew I couldn’t consent on the (one as far as I know) occasion that occurred after he started writing his paper. While that is not rape exactly, I still feel sexually violated.

I moved apartments after we broke up for other reasons (he had submitted his paper at that point, but I did not know). He tried to find out where I lived and showed up at a social event for a mutual friend even though I had told him I was not comfortable being in the same room. He also texted me for about a year wanting to meet in person (during which, still unknown to me, his paper was in review and then in press).

I had to see him in person at a conference (this year, after his paper was published) and he didn’t try to approach, but I had also told two male friends what he had done, and they flanked me the entire time.

He lured me into a furtive relationship that lasted for a few months and destroyed my marriage.  He told me he had had many affairs with graduate students, because he was unhappy in his marriage.  He led me to believe that I was different than the ones who came before and that we had a future.  Then he went back to his wife and cut things off.  I became even more unhinged and depressed and suicidal.   Eventually I told my husband, who was furious with me, understandably.  I felt as though I had sinned, been cast out of the garden, committed a terrible crime.  I blamed myself entirely then.  My husband and I were under a great deal of professional and economic strain at the time, and, tragically, our marriage did not survive the blow.

12/6/2017 12:55:32,"In 1999, I was a master's student in criminology at the university of Toronto in Canada. The director of the centre,  XXX, was one of my profs. He was grooming me for the PHD program and acting as a mentor of sorts and invited me to meet some of his PHD students at a bar after school. He told me that he had to pick up some clothes at the dry cleaners first and then go home to change and drop them off- then we would go to the bar. He asked me to come with him in his car. I was very hesitant to do this. I knew that he had a history of dating his PHD students. I knew from a very good friend that he had left his wife of 30 years for one of his PHD students. 
Reluctantly I went in his car- wanting to meet the PHD students as my goal. When I entered into his house he gave me a tour and showed me every room including his bedroom. I felt very uncomfortable and immediately went downstairs and stood at the front door telling him i would wait there for him. 
Seconds later he came down the stairs with his jeans undone and his penis hanging out. He sat on the love seat in the living room and patted the seat beside him as an invitation to come sit beside him and do as he wished. I was stunned. I didn't say a word and sat in the rocking chair across from him. He took one look at me and said, ""You can go now."" I replied, ""so, we're not going to meet your students?""  He answered, ""you can meet them another time."" 
I left immediately and ran down the street crying. Called my husband from a pay phone and felt sick. 
The next day, I told another student what happened and asked her who i should tell (which profs). She told me to keep my mouth shut and just finish my MA and get out. She said he would make my life hell- he has done it to other students before and no other prof would support me. I was devastated. My dream was to do my PHD.

I twisted away, stood up and walked away. 2) Having a male lecturer who always leered at bachelor students he was teaching show a flip out full of photos of female undergrads to male students and boasting how he slept with them all. 3) While waiting in line at the airport about to go to my first academic conference, got waved at and then hugged and kissed (unwillingly) by one of the ‘infamous’ professor who slept with his PhD.

12/6/2017 11:01:38,"This was perhaps just the bad behavior of the individual, but as a collective, we all chose to remain silent and not report the incidents of sexual harassment on behalf of one of our colleagues. It's possible the administration knew about it, but didn't intervene. For the first two to three years that my cohort was in our PhD, one of our colleagues sexually harassed (groping and overt sexual comments and probably more that I don't personally know about) a large number of women in our program. We laughed about it and talked about it at the time because it was so persistent, but it was actually pretty bad. Why did we just go along with it? One night I was the target of his unwanted harassment. He kept announcing to the small group of people at a professional event that we had ""gotten naked in the bathroom/had sex in the bathroom"" (of course not true). He cornered me several times, trying to grope me and/or kiss me. It was so obvious that that another male colleague stepped in to ask if I was ok. I later called the perpetrator to tell him never to treat me like that again. His excuse was that he was high and he never apologized, just gave me more excuses for his behavior. He later went on to have a ""relationship"" with a young undergraduate student in one of his classes that seemed to have an f***ed up power-dynamic (obviously). I believe he is still teaching, so I would be very worried about hiring him to teach young women. He is winning awards and publishing books these days, so his power and opportunities for teaching are probably increasing. I've heard he is clean now, but I still wouldn't trust him.

12/6/2017 9:46:57,"I was one of four young, female research assistants working for a senior tenured professor at Simon Fraser University, who was also the primary supervisor for my Master's degree. I had moved across the country from Nova Scotia specifically to work with him, because he was internationally recognized for his research on substance use. Prior to moving I spoke with two former students of his, who cautioned me against working with him because he was known to have a temper and didn't work well with women. 

I was 21 and alone in a new city. Initially he was very warm and we enjoyed a great rapport. He brought me on to exciting projects and we co-authored several papers together. He learned that I lived near his home and began suggesting that we have work meetings there, over a glass of wine. I was uncomfortable with these meetings, but felt obligated to go so I wouldn't miss out on research opportunities. The meetings frequently went from the professional to the personal, where he would share intimate details of his life with me: his failed marriage, the child he had co-parented, etc. I felt sorry for him and figured he was just another lonely, work-obsessed academic. 

I began to sense underlying tension and stress at our research center a few months in. I learned through the other RA's that my supervisor was known for being verbally abusive and was prone to screaming at them in person, sending late-night ranting emails, and accusing them of ""sabotaging"" his career. During my time at the center, two of his longest-serving RA's quit, and one of them shared her concerns with the Dean of the Faculty. She was offered a job with the Dean's office, and the university did not take any disciplinary action (that I'm aware of) or check on the well-being of the other Research Assistants under his employment. His other Master's student, a man, quit within 3 months of working with him. 

In my second year, my supervisor invited me to join him on an all-expenses-paid trip to Brazil to work on a collaborative research project. Over the 10-day trip we worked together all day, every day and stayed at the same hotel. He was in great spirits, and I felt like the ""chosen"" student. When I was leaving to return to Canada, he reached across the taxi and held my hand. I did nothing and tried to interpret it as a fatherly gesture. As I was leaving I mentioned I was excited to travel back to Nova Scotia in a few weeks to spend Christmas with my boyfriend.  

Things deteriorated as soon as I returned to Canada. I found a series of long, ranting emails that the other RA's had warned me about. He claimed I had made an error in a literature review that had humiliated him in front of our international collaborators, and accused me of being incompetent and trying to ruin his career. After a string of abusive emails, he cut off virtually all communication with me. I was in the middle of writing up my thesis and he made it clear that he would not be available to support my work. I was completely isolated. 

As Christmas came closer, he told me that I was too far behind to take holidays and that he didn't want me to leave. I did not share details of my travel plans with him, and left. He went found a printout of my travel itinerary at the office and send me a series of belligerent emails where he insisted that I needed to return immediately, claiming that he had left (long-awaited) feedback on my thesis at the office. I phoned my program chair in tears, telling her I needed to find another supervisor. She encouraged me to stay because my defense had already been scheduled and it would be better than starting over. 

I successfully defended my thesis, with a friend in the room for support. I could have pushed for a publication afterwards, but I didn't want to have any further contact with him. He made me feel like a failure. 

My friend (a man) started his PhD with my former supervisor a few months later, and quit shortly after experiencing a screaming tirade where he was insulted and threatened with physical violence (his exact words: ""I will kill you"".). In the years since, I've learned that his abuse was systemic and widely known within the research community (I always get a raised eyebrow from other academics when I mention his name). 

I found myself in a situation where I was totally powerless, had no institutional support and was subjected to verbal abuse and inappropriate romantic overtures from someone I trusted and admired. I know there are people who have experienced far worse, but I've found ways to minimize what happened to me for too long. This experience eroded my confidence in the integrity of the academic system to protect its students, and radically and permanently changed my career trajectory.

As such, graduate students compiled a petition asking for his removal from the board.

We received emails insinuating that we were cowards for remaining anonymous and we were threatened with repercussions for trying to create a safer space.

12/6/2017 7:33:42,"My second master's degree was pursued at a contemporary art institute in northern France. The program was set in a way that through ongoing mentorship, research and creative production is developed. The mentor is given a healthy production budget to create work while accompanying the student/younger artist through the process of developing and creating their work. There are about 12 students in any given year and 4 mentors, leaving each mentor with 3 younger artists to follow and meet regularly with in the studio or as they feel fit. The institution invited a well known French filmmaker as a mentor. He had been accused on a number of accounts for sexual assault and abuse and was, at the time, being tried for an incident concerning a female young actress he had hired for a film.  This man was invited to mentor young artists + film makers and was paired by the institution to work with me. To say the meetings were uncomfortable and inappropriate is an understatement.  We met initially at the studio and since this generated in me feelings of discomfort at later dates we met in an office at the institution as to be in a more public setting.  At each of our meetings we would be quite intoxicated and speaking inappropriately about my body and my work as a female performance artist. He gave no sound guidance or mentorship. We met a total of three times over the course of the year (the program is meant to be an opportunity for far more exchange) with his advances getting more direct each time.  The other two young artists working with him felt similarly - a woman who was also experiencing harassement and a man who felt his mentorship was nothing more than a bar-like conversation.  I stopped meeting with him all together and spoke with the director about my (our) experience. This was not addressed in anyway.

Other colleagues agreed he was ""creepy."" Fast forward 10 years. I was now department chair and it came to my attention that this same guy, who taught poetry writing, was making female undergraduates pretty uncomfortable. Rather than teaching everyone together in a classroom, he held tutorials in his tiny office with the door closed so that he could work with each individual student on her writing. One student came forward when she received an envelope of poems at her home address (which she had not shared with him -- he had gotten the registrar to tell him where she lived). Although he would deny it, the poems were highly suggestive and personal, mentioning, for example, a tattoo on her leg and the street she lived on. He also called her on her cell phone and asked her questions about her boyfriend. He would have students bring some of their art to class so he could help them translate their inspiration into words; in her case he honed in on a photograph in which she appeared in the background, in the shadows, partly nude. (This was in that tiny office with the door closed.) The student filed a complaint, and I had her taken out of the class and asked another colleague to work with her through the rest of the semester so that she could get credit for the course. This was just the first incident. This student filed a complaint which was adjudicated through a complex system that included both the in-house sexual harassment procedure and the state-wide faculty union grievance process. His defense was that he was working very hard with each student to draw out their creative energy based on what he saw in their work, and of course, they explored all kinds of subjects in their work. The fact that they were 20 years old and he was somewhere in his 70s, supposedly mature enough to know where to draw the line, did not seem to register. He had several advocates in the department, all male and quite senior to me, who argued that his writing poems for the students was a matter of free speech, and that stopping it would cast a shadow over the principles of artistic freedom at the school. The poet was able to keep his job with a stern warning, an order not to have students in his office alone, and a remedial sexual harassment training program -- something required by state law that had not really been enforced for adjunct faculty, putting the university in a position of potential liability. He came to my office in the fall and told me he was very sorry, he now understood, and I would never have any trouble with him again. I told him I hoped he meant it. But of course he kept up the same behavior, choosing new students for his obsession each term. After the students saw that he had not been fired, they were very reluctant to bring new complaints against him, and feeling very upset that I had not been able to get justice for the first student, I did not feel I could push them to complain, as I could make no promises. I could only take the incident to the civil rights officer, but without a formal complaint we could go no further. Every time I went to him and told him I knew what he was up to, he wanted to know who complained, and whined about how he had a constitutional right to face his accuser. He denied and denied, and begged me not to take away the only meaningful thing left in his life. After a couple of these incidents he seems to have understood he couldn't do this with students in his class, but decided it would be ok to stalk random students he saw in the halls. Two years after my term was up, he turned his attention to a graduate student, followed her to the cafeteria, invited himself to have lunch with her, offered to help her with recommendations, etc. She didn't like it but she felt she had to be polite to a professor. Then he wrote a little play and e-mailed it to her. There was immediately a second e-mail saying ""maybe you shouldn't open that other e-mail but just delete it."" Naturally she opened it. It was very explicit. She brought it to public safety, who called HR, and at last he was escorted out of the building and banned from campus. The grievance procedure dragged on for over a year with his old friends declaiming over and over the violation of his civil rights, but the firing was upheld at last.",Chair of a large liberal arts department,Adjunct professor,Other Type of School,,Art history,,"The academic advising office and the civil rights compliance officer jumped into action immediately. The faculty member filed a grievance with the faculty union, so that the union officers were obliged to shepherd him through a multi-stage grievance hearing.

12/6/2017 3:02:01,"As a job candidate on a campus visit, male members of the department staff entered my hotel room against my explicitly expressed wishes. On two different occasions (is this a thing?) (It was early 2000s, so I'm hoping things have changed...)

In the first campus visit, my unwelcome guest followed me to the room after I picked up the key at the hotel reception desk. He had been helping me by pulling my (very small) wheelie-bag. Once I had my key, I told him 'thanks so much, I'll take it from here.' He responded by not handing the bag over, but proceeding down the hall toward the room, the number of which he evidently knew. At the door of the room, I thanked him again and expressed my gratitude for his having met me at the airport etc. and told him I was looking forward to continuing our discussion of local colonial history over dinner. I reached for my bag which he relinquished. I then pulled it over towards me, turned, and opened the door. He then held the door open for me as I pulled the bag in to the room. I stopped, turned back, and said, 'thanks again' only to have him push past me into the hotel room. I had told him - three times - that I didn't want him in my hotel room, despite whatever pedagogical benefit he thought his presence my have for me. In the room, he stood by the bed and explained the history of the view out the window. I interjected to tell him I was tired after my flight and needed to rest/freshen up before meeting the person driving me to the dinner.  I walked back and stood at the room door, holding it open.  He left.

I didn't think this was 'sexual harassment' so much as just plain rude. So I wrote this first incident off as 'just weird', figuring they'd sent someone with poor social skills who thought it would be more important for me to understand local economy history as written in the landscape than feel safe and have my boundaries respected. Not someone I necessarily wanted to have as a colleague, but, ok, whatever.... At least they let me know this guy likely wouldn't listen to me on any other matter either....

On the second visit - same thing, campus visit for a TT position - this happened after the obligatory second night's more informal dinner with grad students and faculty. So I was already exhausted from a 22 hour long-haul flight, the research presentation, interview, teaching demonstration, first breakfast meeting, meeting with the Dean, meeting with grad students, and a trip to a local attraction, we had this last dinner. And, after dinner, Prof A suggested we go on to a pub that was on the walking route back to my hotel. Since I was in one of those disciplines where there's a culture of pub-going and it's very important, in terms of perceived 'fit', for a female candidate to show she has a sense of humour and can hold a drink, I knew this was still the 'fit' part of the interview. 

After what I thought was two rounds of drinks, it was arranged that Prof A would walk me back from the pub to the hotel - short distance, but easy to get lost and 'not safe' for a woman alone.  I had a breakfast meeting the next morning, then that was it - my breakfast interviewer, Prof B, would take me directly to the airport afterwards. 

Prof A and I had been discussing teaching and pedagogy in our research area and how to integrate research into undergrad teaching over our post-dinner drink. As we walked up to the front of my hotel, I suggested I could pass on some course outlines I'd put together but not circulated during my interview. These covered areas of pedagogical strategy we'd discussed in the pub and he could add them to the file the selection panel would review. Total mistake.

The course outlines were in the 'interview folder' I'd left in my hotel room earlier that even. So we walked Into the hotel lobby and I motioned to the chairs in the reception area and told him 'please wait here, I'll only be a minute.'   He ignored that and followed me on to the elevator. His lack of response to my directions showed me he was clearly more inebriated than I had initially thought.  Despite my telling him to wait at the elevator, he followed me to the room door. I couldn't believe this was actually happening (again), but I didn't want to be rude (or violent.)  Despite my telling him, even more firmly to 'wait at the door' and pulling it so it would close behind me -  in his face - he pushed the door open, came into the room, and then stretched out on the bed....  So I gave him the course outlines by tossing them on top of his chest. Then I told him 'you need to go home NOW', relieved that the room layout meant I could easily sprint for it and lock myself in the bathroom. Thanks be, he finally got the message and left. 

By the time I got to breakfast with Prof B, I was furious that I'd found myself in that position while ON A CAMPUS VISIT JOB INTERVIEW. TWICE.",Job applicant on a campus interview on both occasions,Member of the interviewing department's faculty and selection committee,"More Than One Institution (feel free to elaborate in ""Comments"")","University of Minnesota, Duluth/University of Kentucky, Lexiington",Geography,,"I didn't report the first incident, because it seemed to be simply a very 'tone-deaf' senior male academic being insensitive. 

I reported the second incident in somewhat indirect terms to Prof B.  I explained to him that I had been somewhat disconcerted by the end of the previous evening because Prof A had become pretty inebriated and had followed me into the hotel and up to my room. I explained I had felt compelled to be rather rude to him to get him to leave my room. I told Prof B that Prof A's actions had made me very uncomfortable. I asked if Prof A had issues around boundaries with younger/junior female colleagues and Prof B gave me an answer in the affirmative. Prof B discouraged me from taking the job, suggesting my career would be better off if I stayed on the fixed-term contract post-doc I held at the time. Prof B did not suggest any institutional reporting or wider discussion...  I couldn't figure out if this advice was meant for my own well-being or because Prof B favoured another candidate.

I noted that as a very weak institutional response, which gave me no confidence in departmental culture. I was offered the job. And decided that I wouldn't take it  because I couldn't face dealing with Prof A (or Prof B) and couldn't imagine that this awkward encounter or any further/future issues along the same lines wouldn't be interpreted as reflecting badly on me in that particular department and in the wider discipline. 

I eventually discussed the reasons behind my decision to decline a very good TT job with a male mentor in my discipline. He confirmed that Prof A had a history of striking up 'inappropriate' relationships with grad students and junior faculty members. Subsequent discussions with Prof A's former graduate students (male) confirmed this was the case.  One colleague explained to me that it was more or less just part of a female colleague's necessary professional skills to be able to navigate that dynamic, because we were all adults. 

","Nil, as far as I am aware.","Ironically, I was successful in both interviews. But I came away so uncomfortable with my glimpse of 'departmental culture' in both places that I declined two TT jobs.","The first incident shook me a little. The second really undermined my self-confidence and I associated it with a subsequent episode of mild depression, treated with counselling. I found it very difficult to be productive and to be enthused about publishing the in field of my PhD - my work overlapped significantly with Prof A's and that of several of his students and proteges. I'd been really excited about working with him as a mentor and collaborator in terms of developing my future projects and publications.  I came away feeling rootless and unenthused about my academic career. Here, I'd put all my efforts into what had been an effective pitch for at TT job in what was a high-profile research cluster internationally. And what mattered to the high-flying research powerhouse professor in my field seemed to be my 'pleasing personality' and possible availability for an extramarital liaison...., not my research or possible trajectory etc. So, narcissistic wound and much anxiety created... And I associated what happened with not being 'on top of my game' after long plane flights and the cross-cultural differences in communication involved in interviewing in the USA (not being American myself)...which was both minute self-blame and a huge extrapolation. I decided I needed coaching on being less 'pleasing' and more forceful in interview contexts etc.","I started collaborating with people outside my discipline and publishing in other areas, so became very interdisciplinary and very cynical about the culture of recognition in my PhD discipline. Career-wise I remained in my post-doc and then eventually converted that into a contract Research Fellowship.  I never applied for another job in the USA. I eventually took up a continuing appointment in a third country.  This means I no longer live on the same continent as a my parents and most of my immediate family. I have a career, but it's a different one, with a different trajectory and location.","Once is happenstance, twice is coincidence... three times is way more than a bad habit - it's a culture of harassment. I'd like to know if a) anyone else has had this experience of being harassed/treated inappropriately as a campus visit candidate (I usually find I'm never alone in this stuff) and b) if any departments have actually briefed faculty involved in the interview process that the job candidates hotel rooms are 'out of bounds' and private space, even if they are paid for by the host institution.

12/6/2017 0:41:15,"It started with comments of my PhD supervisor on my physical appearance, which I brushed off and ignored by changing the subject. He started asking me to come to events, to which I believed other people would go as well. These occasions turned out just being me and him leaving me to feel uncomfortable, as he was clearly trying to single me out. I kept mentioning my long-term partner of 9 years to highlight that I have no interest whatsoever in anything other than professional exchange. During supervision meetings I placed my bag on the chairs next to me, so he couldn't sit too close. He sent several emails,  complimenting on/or using vulgar language about my body parts. As ""welcome"", he patted me on the head in front of students I was supposed to give a lecture to. Perplexed about what happened I simply overrode the deep embarrassment and simply gave the lecture in the hope nobody noticed it. He patted me another time on the head at a school exhibition opening, where I finally had the guts to ask him to stop this behaviour. His response was: ""But this is the only accessible part of your body?"". My reply: ""NO part of my body is accessible to you!"". After this, I reported him to my research department since the behaviour got worse and his harassment more invasive. I stopped avoiding him and remained as professional as much as I could, but my dismissal just made him come on stronger. He tried to kiss me at the end of the last supervision meeting I ever had with him, walking all across the room towards me before I've almost left the space. I prevented the kiss and walked off, fuming, of course. The other second supervisor that time, made inappropriate and sleazy comments about my physical appearance (my legs, staring overly long at my chest and between my legs), offered zero practical advice with regards to the PhD and boasted at public events in front of others that he won't read my writing anyway as he had ""more important things to do"". I had nobody to talk to and felt utterly ashamed that this was happening to me. My initial reports to the research department were only met with disbelief and embarrassment, but no concrete advise or action followed the report. 
My avoidance of the two supervisors soon turned the atmosphere sour, so the backlashes started to happen: the supervisor now tried to boycott an exam, a promised lecturer position fell all of a sudden through, he called on my private mobile phone only to shout at me for minutes. He started side-lining me, shared my confidential research documents with his other PhD students without permission and started using my work for his course development.

12/5/2017 23:54:56,"As a PhD student, I found myself mired in icky ambiguously sexual circumstances with 2 different professors. The least awful was a professor who held his final seminar session in a bar over pitchers of beer & then invited me to for a bite to eat afterward. I hoped we were going to talk about my project &  thought surely he meant we'd grab a burger or some quick Thai food. But then he walked me into an expensive white table cloth restaurant and proceeded to order appetizers and wine and all these things he surely knew I could not afford. So reluctantly and awkwardly I let him pay, which made me feel crazy. After, he casually said let's go to my place to finish talking about your paper & I really really really wanted to go home but didn't know how to say that and felt so strange about having been treated to such an expensive meal. It sounds insane but I couldn't figure out how to get out of this night with him. It was all so confusing b/c in class he talked all the time about his kids and wife (""my wife"" and never by name. She was a fairly visible feminist & in hind sight, I see that he leveraged her feminism all the time to position himself as a feminist. UGH.) Anyway, I felt terribly embarrassed to be taking this as a date when he had made himself out to be such a family man & felt confused about how to extract myself, especially because I was still hoping for help in publishing the essay I had written for his seminar and that I cared so passionately about. That was icky but it was only 1 seminar and 1 grade at stake. More shattering was the next year when I was promoted from graduate teaching assistant to the prized fellowship everyone wanted - assistant editor to a very prestigious journal. The editor, my boss and a leading feminist, was both gate-keeper in my field and now boss of my graduate fellowship. She held in hand, then, both my immediate daily survival and the keys to my future, a future I had leveraged with considerable student loans. Although my fellowship contract obligated me to provide 20 hours a week of editing work, my boss expanded the duties to include coordinating dry cleaning, car repairs, credit card disputes, out-out-town fee-based speaking engagements and travel plans, etc. I wasn't allowed to go home for winter break b/c it was time to copy edit the galleys. This makes no sense b/c the journal was published in Baltimore by Johns Hopkins & we were editing on the west coast. So what did it matter where I finished the galleys? My boss never looked at the articles after the initial content editing was done anyway so it's not like we needed to collaborate. What I'm trying to explain is how I felt a little imprisoned, almost indentured. Sexual harassment was the cherry on top of this toxic covenant. I felt uncomfortable all the time & started wearing baggy clothing, which my boss hated. One time in front of my peers, she mocked the overalls I was wearing, exclaiming, ""I can fit a fist in your pants"" and then proceeded to shove not 1 but 2 fists into my crouch, right there in front of everyone. Another time at a conference, after I had just presented my paper and people were swarming to congratulate and ask me questions, she interrupted everything to spank me, right there in front of my peers and prospective future employers. I was mortified and I swear my brain stayed frozen for many days after that incident. I was so stuck and had sacrificed everything for this opportunity to study so I thought I had to accept the behavior. I thought I was managing but was so surprised each morning to discover that my pillow was wet. I lived in a crappy apartment so naturally I looked for a ceiling leak that might be the source of the wet pillow. Honestly, I really thought it was caused by an environmental leak until I finally realized my pillow was soggy from the salt tears I had been weeping in my sleep. I guess my conscious hours were so completely indentured that the only time I could cry was during sleep. I was trapped in a viciously competitive environment and so we students carefully guarded our secrets from each other. (Tragically, then, we didn't support each other or warn one other of possible hazards.) For this reason, I suspect but can not confirm that at least 2 other women in my program also may have experienced sexual coercion and harassment. One of them may have been in an even more precarious position than me b/c she was on a student visa and needed this professor's support to maintain her visa status.  
I completed my degree because I’m not a “quitter.” But I never asked for a letter of recommendation and I never once checked to see what jobs might be available in my field. All I could do was flee the entire sphere of influence. I paid off my student loans by working in a field unrelated to my training and in fact one for which a college degree is entirely unnecessary. I maintain that the abuse changed the course of my life, a fact about which I am still bitter.
I’m telling you this now for several reasons.
1. I’m tired of holding it in my body and am ready to release this bitterness.
2. I believe that young students are vulnerable and should be entitled to a safe place in which to complete their educations.
3. College & graduate students are impressionable; the reality is that they are being cultivated as future workers & bosses in every sector of our economy. In this way, sexual misconduct on our campuses contributes to and perpetuates an insidious culture of harassment which spreads throughout the entire economy. For this reason, campus abuse has the potential to harm all workers, not just college students and graduates. 
4. Although I am grateful for my education and believe that you can never foreclose on the knowledge and thinking skills I carry in my head, technically I don’t use my education because I felt too traumatized to pursue the career I studied. 
5. My education was partially funded with public dollars which subsidized my graduate fellowship and student loans. One could argue this public investment was wasted because I never attempted to work in the field for which I trained. If you buy my statement that I was deterred by systematic abuse, that is an egregious betrayal of the public trust & resources. 
",I was a PhD student. ,"My perpetrators were tenured professors. As indicated, one was my teacher for only a single seminar & in a different department, so it wasn't quite as shattering as the abuse by the person governing my fellowship & keeping watch at the gates of the field I hoped to enter.

",None. ,Devastating. I never tried to pursue the career for which I trained. I was too traumatized. ,I was terribly depressed for months and months and did fantasize about suicide.  ,"As I indicated above, I got as far away from the academy as I possibly could.

But I am able to provide for my family, ensuring that my daughter has access to an excellent education. Although she's not quite old enough to know why I am so insistent about this, I have been teaching her since she was very young that education is all about allowing yourself to be mentored. But you must choose your own mentors wisely. Do not EVER let them choose you. You  must be the agent in that choice. ","P.S. This happened in the early 1990s.

Initially, I was thrilled that he took an interest in showing me the ropes of academia because I was in my early PhD program years and my faculty advisor was on sabbatical.

This carried on for years. The inquiries of my dating life came sporadically but when they did, they were very intrusive with an underlying tone of questioning who I was intimate with. Some other extremely uncomfortable exchanges happened, with him showing up to events that were student only gatherings that he happened to “serendipitously” come upon.

12/5/2017 19:15:58,"I am a Canadian who was hired at a university in Washington State as an Assistant Professor in Materials Science and Chemistry.  I found the transition from graduate school, which I found to be collegial and enjoyable, to the highly competitive world of American academia to be very difficult. Sometime in my second year at WSU I was reading one of Jane Goodal's books. I was sitting in a faculty when I suddenly realized that I was surrounded by a classic primate male dominance pecking order, and that I was the male at the bottom. Until I had arrived at WSU I had been a quite successful student and postdoc, so needless to say I found my new position to low status to be difficult. The department had quite dysfunctional dynamics at the time and quite a lot of energy was expended by the faculty making sure that everyone stayed in their place in the pecking order.  I did notice that the two women in the department were treated differently. They were not so much part of the pecking order, and for this I envied them. I simply wanted to be valued for who I was and to make a contribution. The environment was not encouraging and I often felt humiliated. I did not thrive this environment.   I left after four years.  After a lot of soul searching and with guidance from the book ""What Color is My Parachute"" I was able  to redirect my life. I have since had quite successful career in industry.

At the same time, I do feel that people in academia should be expected to work harder  than other people and for less money. They have the privilege of being able to focus on their life's work, rather than working for someone else.  But, if one does not have a life's work, then why bother, there are better things out there, I promise you.

The focus should be on finding the most talented people, with a passion to pursue their interests despite the obstacles.   It turns out that it was not for me, but I do acknowledge that great human progress has been made by giving selected people (mostly, but not exclusively, men) the opportunity to pursue their interests to the exclusion of all else (e.g. Newton, Einstein, Stephen Hawkings, John Polanyi,  Margaret MacDonald, Jane Goodall, etc.).",,not sure it is relevant,43074802752,yes,Other,Chemistry/Materials Science,Chemistry,Assistant Professor,Assistant,R2,I'd rather not say,1521,,Chemistry;Materials Science

One of my former professors asked me to join him to do some fieldwork. I agreed and we spent one evening locally and then one weekend out of town, conducting field research and collecting samples. It was professional and productive the whole time and on the overnight trip we stayed in separate rooms at a hotel. He paid for both rooms and for all meals. When we returned late at night from the weekend of sampling, he dropped me off in the parking lot on campus where my car was parked. Before I exited the vehicle, he put his hand on my leg and bent forward to kiss me. I turned my head and he kissed me on the cheek. He said he had romantic intentions and wanted to start an affair. He confessed that he had had an affair some years previously with one of this graduate students but that because I was no longer his student nor employee, that it would be OK to be with him. I declined his advances, said goodnight, and left the car.

I later heard from a friend that she has also been approached by him in a similar manner some time earlier and that, unbeknowst to me, he had a bit of a reputation for this kind of behaviour. This made me think I was a stupid idiot for getting into the situation and for being so naive.

The post-doc suggested collaborating on a number of projects and I was very excited by the prospect of professional collaboration, as the research sounded very interesting and might lead to publications. The post-doc then thought that because we spent time together discussing research as well as personal matters and news/popular culture, and occasionally shared a meal in a public restaurant, that meant we were ""going out"", that I was his girlfriend; he repeatedly tried to put his arm around me or to hold hands with me. Every time this happened I said that I was not his girlfriend and that I wanted to keep the relationship professional. He said he would be going to another country for another postdoc and he asked me to join him after I was finished my PhD, so that we could collaborate. He said he would pay all expenses. He offered to help me finish my PhD by writing one or more chapters, and by paying my tuition. I declined his offer and reminded him that I was not his girlfriend. I told him that I was disappointed that he had turned a cordial professional relationship into something that made me very uncomfortable. I stopped doing my PhD work in the office unless I knew that he would not be there, and I tried to avoid him whenever possible. He left to do his other postdoc and much international traveling, and he kept sending me letters and gifts for years afterwards, from all over the globe. I never replied to or acknowledged his mail.

I am an East Asian female graduate student, who began a close polyamorous relationship with a white male graduate student in my first year of studies (Fall 2015). He is three years senior to me, and is writing his dissertation on feminism. It started off as a good relationship, and he was only seeing me when we became involved. I had no reason not to trust him (he expressed very radical and progressive views on race, feminism, and sexuality), and was happy for him to begin seeing other people.

But in the short span of a few months, it slowly but surely escalated into a situation where he was (1) sleeping with two other East Asian women on campus, (2) had slept with two other East Asian women on trips overseas, and (3) was sexting a half-Asian woman who was in another country. Before meeting, he had also been involved with several Asian woman. One of them was an female undergraduate in philosophy he saw when he was already a graduate student, and their relationship ended terribly for her.

The fetishistic nature of all of this slowly got to me, and it was emotionally devastating as he was someone I had come to trust. Our relationship deteriorated and ended very badly. There was a lot of gaslighting involved, and many attempts to make me feel guilty and blame the other women involved, but I eventually realised that he was the one with the problem.

The relationship ended extremely badly, and I developed PTSD shortly afterwards. I was afraid to be on campus and in my department, for fear of seeing him and the other women on campus. He also lives right next to the department (his room can be seen a short distance away from the main entrance). The PTSD was debilitating, and has affected me from Spring 2016 to now (Fall 2017). It set back my work and personal life in many ways. Amongst other symptoms, I had multiple panic attacks daily. My mental health problems were exacerbated by my knowledge that he was literally being paid to do research on feminism.

As no crime or policy violation had been committed, the department could do nothing other than to offer me psychological support, and extensions on incomplete work. I am thankful for them.

Another man and I boarded the elevator. As the doors were closing, a female graduate student boarded; she stood between us and the door. We all faced forward, toward the door. For no apparent reason, except perhaps to show he was one of the guys and maybe had had too much to drink, the other man pretended to grab her ass and looked at me for my ""locker room"" approval of his antics. I admit that I smiled and suppressed a chuckle so that she wouldn't hear. Now I would frown disapprovingly, but then I admitted to playing the role of ""of one the guys."" She never knew what happened. No one else was there. The man has since become a very powerful person, the Director of a major Institute in North America. Since she was (and is) unaware of what happened, I am unsure if this is harassment but I suppose it would be contributing to a hostile work environment if I felt it did.

12/5/2017 14:36:51,"Numerous incidents with several male faculty.  One stands out as the worst, but the others were just as worthy of being written here. I will stick with this one: A tenured professor repeatedly came to my office taking up increasingly large amounts of my time talking about nothing, trying to get me to talk about my ""feelings"" and my childhood, and repeatedly talking about his as a way of asking me about mine.  After trying to get the person to back off in nice-ish ways, such as by saying that I had a lot of work to do (this did not stop the person), I had to begin asking this professor more bluntly to please back off a bit, such as by talking about professional and personal boundaries and how I needed him to respect these. The professor did not stop. He flooded me with emails, most of which were bizarre and prying emails. If I did not answer them soon after they were sent (and they were sent not just during the work week but at nights and on weekends as well), then he would then come to my office and insist that we talk / have a long discussion about this --i.e., about why I did not answer his emails, about what my feelings were about his emails, and about how he was hurt that I had not answered. When I tried to avoid these meetings by insisting that he respect work/professional boundaries he also started insisting that he had no idea what ""my"" boundaries were, that the only way he could know this was to test them, and so I *had* to answer his questions about my feelings. he continued to send me inappropriate emails and to visit to my office and demand long periods of my time. Some of these emails said things like: he wanted to start a fan club for me, he wanted to work together with me on academic articles, he wanted to do a book reading club with me (so that I would have to spend endless amounts of time talking with him about some book), and did I like/would I accept hugs..... Since nothing was working and he kept insisting he could not know what *my* boundaries were, I had to make them very clear: I outlined in an email that I would not answer his emails on the weekends or at night, that I would not answer any emails that were not strictly work related, and that --since there was really absolutely nothing we needed to email about relating to work-- I did not want to receive more than one email from him a week.  I also said that I probably would not be able to answer this email right away, and that he needed to accept that it may take me a day or so to get back to him.  He flipped out and tried to tell me that the whole reason I had gotten the job was because HE pushed for me to be hired, and the whole reason he had done this was because he thought that he and I were going to be good friends. He had thought I was one of those people he could really connect with, and he was so hurt. And he was angry that he had been mistaken about this....etc. He sort of threw a tantrum. For the first week after this he did send me a single email.  The second week I received no contact from him at all, and I thought finally I had managed the situation. But the third week he stopped me in the hallway to say that I had not answered his last email. Confused, I told him that I had. It turned out that he had sent me an email the second week, but he sent it to the wrong address (to a student's address).  Because I had not received it, he reforwarded it to me, then also sent me another email. Both of these emails had nothing to do with work, but were all about his feelings around this new situation. He also printed out an additional letter and shoved it under my door. AND he put a card in my mail box with Hershey's ""kisses"" and ""hugs"" taped to it. This was all within the span of 2 or 3 days. And then, when I did not respond to any of these, he called me on the phone in my office (from his office) to find out why I was not responding.  I had to go to the department chair for advice. And things just got worse from there.",Visiting Assistant Professor,"Much older, tenured professor",Other R1,Rochester Institute of Technology,Social Sciences,,"(1) The chair at the time ORDERED me to file an HR complaint against this faculty member. I was a Visiting Assistant Professor. Women on my committee told me to NOT file a complaint or it would make me seen as a liability and end my career.  I was pressured and harassed by HR people with repeated calls over a period of weeks, with them trying to make me file and with my chair ""ordering"" me to file. Neither my chair nor HR told me that filing was optional (though I knew they could not make me do it).  My chair also ""ordered"" me to go see a counselor at the Center for Gender and... something else.  I told him that I was not sure I wanted to do that and he told me this was not optional, it was required.  My chair also ""ordered"" me to print out all of my email communications with this professor and to write up a summary of all of the office visits I had had. I did these things, and I visited the campus Center on Gender.... but I did not file a complaint.  There were multiple issues of harassment and discrimination at this university that impacted me (it turns out --I was told-- that there were several lawsuits against this institution at the time, including --again, I was told-- a class action lawsuit for sexual harassment and sexual/racial discrimination. I was also told that at least one student had filed a complaint against this professor, but nothing was done.). 

Later, I had another problem with another male faculty member who came to my office and would not leave. This faculty member was not tenure-track, but he now has a tenure track job.

I also had a problem with a separate male faculty member who expected me to do all of the work on a campus event we were supposed to be organizing together, but then to allow him to take all of the credit. I did everything, particularly bringing the speakers and attendees to the event; but he claimed he had done it all (he didn't even know the speakers, or anything about the topic of the event, so it was fine that he did not help any more than giving some of his budget to the event. It was problematic that he and the department chair told the Dean of the college that HE was the one who did it all, and therefore HE should be promoted to this or that position). This faculty member was not even in my department at the time. He was a lecturer in another department who had inherited a Native center on campus from a tenured professor who had left and arranged to have this professor run it. He was also friends with the chair who wanted to bring him --and his center-- into the department.  He is now in that department on a tenure-track line.

Still later I had another problem with a faculty member, a Research Professor who brought grant money into the university, who demanded that I use my personal Facebook connections with Native people in order to bring people out to his Symposium on Languages AND he wanted me to *make* one traditional Native leader that I knew show up at his event so that he could use that for positive event publicity. He did not want the Native leader to *speak* at his event, though this was a nationally respected leader for his language revitalization efforts.  Instead, he wanted this leader and all of my Native friends to come sit and listen to a bunch of academics talk and theorize about the revitalization efforts these people were already doing in their own communities. I told this professor that I did not think his requests were appropriate. I did ask him for more information on his Symposium, and I offered input on how to make the event more relevant to the people he wanted to attract. But he did not like this idea, did not give me any real information on his event, and then wound up complaining about me to the new department chair because of my lack of help. The department chair acted as if I was some huge problem because I would not act as a secretary and exploit all of my friends for the event this professor was organizing that had nothing to do with me. I had not been asked or agreed to help work on this event with this professor, and I hadn't even gotten any viable information on the event.

This graduate student told me that there was a group outing for the REU students happening and that he could drive me over from the lab. I didn't know anyone else yet, and I believed him that there was an event. He lied; there was no such event, and I ended trapped with him in a bad part of town that didn't have any public transportation (this was before uber). I was a 19-year-old summer intern without a car. He put his arm around me and ushered me around, forcing me to go with him to various spots. I was very uncomfortable and told him I wanted to go back, because he was my only ride out. I had him drop me off a distance from where I lived, but he followed me back to my apartment, where he kissed me and wouldn't let go of me. I had to use all of my strength to force him off of me and literally ran away from him and locked the door. I told my direct supervisor about it, who told me that I was being unfair to him and that I should go on a date with him after all that effort that he went to. My direct supervisor, a grad student, also told me in private (in the cleanroom) that he thought that women did not belong in science as they (we) were not naturally good at it. He said that he thought women were better suited to cooking and cleaning. At the same institution, the Principal Investigator also trapped me in his office and had me sit behind his desk with him, uncomfortably close, in order to watch some laser safety training videos. He just stared at my breasts the entire time. I had no idea what to do. Again at the same institution, there was a lab technician who got too close to me and made some lewd comments about my appearance. This was all within the span of 3 months.

The person assigned to supervise me called me at home at inappropriate times and asked inappropriate questions. Though there was never explicit sexual content to his behavior, it was always lurking at the edges as he stared in lechy ways and made creepy or misogynistic comments. I worried that if I didn't talk to him at all hours or listen to his bizarre ranting, especially about female colleagues, that he would blackball me with other professors or in my graduate school applications (he insisted throughout the autumn that he should be writing to support my grad school applications and though I never gave him a form, I was still afraid he'd do something to jeopardize my career). In the second semester, he cut my hours and told me that I would instead help him with his research because there weren't enough students needing tutorial work--a situation that meant I would have more personal contact with him, the last thing I wanted. I was desperate not to lose the income that the teaching was supposed to give me at that crucial moment of completing the work that would help me get into a top graduate program. I tried to wriggle politely out of the awkward situations without talking about the creepiness; fortunately my undergrad mentor intervened to ask that the supervisor assign me to one of his groups instead. Rumors flew around his behavior with grad students and even a female faculty member. I was afraid to tell my mentors or the dean, though I later did talk about it at some length with one professor who shared stories far worse than those I'd been hearing but said that issues had been raised with the chair and dean--to no avail.

When he later invited me to dinner at his house to meet other senior academics who, he said, could be good for me to know, I felt I had to accept. I went to his house (there were, thankfully, other people there), and he told me that he was lonely and single, and that I should break up with my boyfriend. I called my boyfriend, told him to pick me up, and never talked to that man again, and stayed far away from him. I only told my boyfriend and close friends what had happened.

This is not to say #NotAllProfs but just to say that having to think about those questions made me reflect: if I *had* been harassed, what would I have done? We now have staff (and one faculty member) who have put themselves forward as being ""safe spaces,"" having undergone some kind of formal training towards such, for students who might have been harassed or belittled; but the one faculty member isn't tenured and the staff is, unsurprisingly, low in the hierarchy, so if I were harassed and reported it to them I wouldn't honestly expect anything productive to come out of the event. The other aspect of my program I'm thinking of: I'm currently a GRA for a multi-prof writing project, and the participants--who all know each other, and are all tenured--routinely blow off deadlines and generally treat each other, in actions if not in words, with contempt. And I'm thinking: if it's that hard to police something as simple as ""you need to get the portion of the paper by me to X date,"" how on earth are we going to police stuff like harassment? I feel like the academia-as-a-cult metaphor might be useful here: thinking about how hard it can be to call out bad behavior within the cult (or, if ""cult"" is too pejorative a word, tightly-knit group--the church organization, the small town, the we're-all-in-this-together small business, etc.) might shed some light on how to restructure academia so that bad behavior is punished and potential bad behavior is discouraged. I mean, I would never correct a victim of harassment or assault (which is to say, me and almost every woman I know) if she wanted to talk about ""toxic masculinity,"" but I think that the framework of toxic masculinity, as important as it is to talk about, doesn't quite get at solving the problem, which may have more to do with social hierarchies and demonstrating power within the group. (I.e. if you can violate group norms *and get away with it*, you have demonstrated your power to the larger group.

A member of the staff (quasi-faculty, non-tenured) whose role was conceptualized as outreach (Director of a national non-profit located within an academic program, which virtually all organizations focused on the discipline belong to) became notably obsessed with a former grad assistant and current grad assistant of his supervisor.  The behavior was not overtly threatening, and he consulted me about his ""crush"" on one of the two. He was also dating a friend of mine at the time.  His supervisor asked me about it eventually, as did his girlfriend, because he told them/me about efforts to engage both parties, including eventually asking the graduate assistant to his boss out and being rejected, but continuing to make reasons to talk to, address, work with, and so on the assistant.  There was gossip about him ""leering"" at the assistant, and he and his girlfriend had a fight about the former assistant, when he tricked her into going to a concert at which he knew both the current and former assistants would be there, at which he was highly focused on the two assistants and not on his girlfriend. His girlfriend told me she felt he was ""obsessed"" with both, and told me after the concert incident that she felt he might be stalking them.

12/5/2017 7:33:42,"He picked me out of a crowd at the university's graduation ceremony, my first schoolwide event - immediately started flirting, and followed me out to my car, saying, ""Don't let people see we're talking, they'll get the wrong idea,"" a huge, shit-eating grin on his face. I dismissed it as odd, but looking back, that was a GIGANTIC red flag - why would you even think to say that?
A casual friendship progressed to constantly asking me out through many ""no""s. He would corner me in an empty hallway and tell me how beautiful I was, and that I'd regret not going on a date with him, details of his current (evidently prolific) sex life and how he'd pull younger women (I was 26 and he was 40).  My dismissal of his interest just made him come on stronger.  The most egregious incident was after I went to lunch with him; he tried to kiss me in the parking lot of the school, in the close quarters of his car.  I pushed him away; he's 6'7"" and muscular, so I consider myself lucky that he didn't push further than that.  
He claimed another employee had a crush on him and was jealous of me. I have no idea if this was true; I do know he was using the story to try to emphasize how ""lucky"" I was that he was paying me attention, i.e. that SOME women would fall over backwards for him, but he was choosing ME.  He emphasized that last part rather often; that despite all the other women he was seeing and bedding, he'd drop them for me in an instant.
I had heard from other women that he was known for this sort of thing, though I don't know to what extent.  I know he had asked out my predecessor as well; she had warned me.  It's one of the reasons I never reported it to the school - I knew he was more valuable to them than I was, so why bother. (For-profit school, awful corporate administration.) I was at this school less than a year (2014), so all this occurred in a pretty compressed timeframe.
He got engaged and brought in his new fiancee shortly before I left; I still wonder if maybe he had been dating her the whole time, which in some ways adds another layer of ""yikes"" to the whole thing.

The lift door opened and we walked together to our research centre and he continued behaving as if nothing had happened.

12/5/2017 4:44:46,"Two incidents. 1. 1980s: I was a grad student and an extremely famous visiting scholar whose class I was taking body-blocked his office door and pressured me to come back to his lodgings one night. Something similar happened to the other woman grad student in the class. There were reporting procedures in place for faculty who harassed undergrads, but not grad students, at the time, and it was not entirely uncommon for faculty and grad students to become involved.  When I told my mentors in the dept. -- all women -- they 'tsked' and said it was a shame but just to do my best work in the class and hope for a good grade.  In the end, he gave everyone in the class the same grade without, evidently, having read the papers. (I should say, however, that harassment was so common for women at the time, I finally just shrugged the incident off. Recently, however, when I attempted to tell fellow academics about it, some -- including women -- reacted with denial, saying they could not believe that the scholar would do that, both because it contradicted his politics and because he later became involved with a man.) 2. Late 1990s: I had my first job, a visiting appointment.  The new department chair, appointed from another university, took an evidently unusual liking to me, appointed me to committees and positions inappropriate for a visitor, and told me that if I did well in these he would try to arrange a tenure-track job. I had come from a working-class background where I was used to this kind of thing at jobs and didn't realize that it was not proper academic procedure. He made remarks strongly implying to fellow faculty that we were having an affair. I tried to imply back that this was no so, but did not feel free to say anything that would upset him. They treated me very poorly. An added complication was that a few key woman faculty members appeared to be highly jealous, as he was considered very dashing, as well as understandably resentful of this special treatment -- though I had not asked for it and didn't know what to do about it. I went to a compliance officer, and was told that I could file a report, but that it would very likely be damaging to my career; this seemed true, so I didn't. In the end, he did try to arrange a tenure-track appointment; the rest of the department quietly rebelled; he was made to step down as chair for other reasons; my visiting appointment was ended a year early due to 'budgetary considerations'; and I was forced to leave for another -- thankfully, much better and saner -- visiting job elsewhere. (Here I should make a caveat as well. I do not believe that he realized what he was doing was harassment. He seemed genuinely to feel that I was a person of special ability -- or to project that upon me -- and that we were beginning a meaningful working, and romantic, relationship.  His last relationship had been with one of this grad students, who then became his colleague, elsewhere. At the new institution, he said, he felt lonely and misunderstood. Because I did not feel myself in a position to tell him what I really felt, he took my politeness as confirmation. I say this not to defend him in any possible way but to slightly nuance such situations, in which the powerful do not view their imposition as one of force or violence, but are rather unable to see that it is inappropriate to use underlings to fulfill their physical and/or emotional needs.  I also believe that this explains why so much of this behavior is generationally-bound -- that younger faculty may have more cultural awareness. I would also like to say, however, that I feel complicit in having accepted special treatment on this basis, though. The flip side to harassment no one's talking about is unfairness to those passed over for opportunities in favor of the direct target. Not to victim-blame; however -- as Laura Kipnis argues in a recent New York Review of Books piece rather sharper than some of her previous works -- women are not children. As long as some stand to benefit from playing into traditional gender roles, or passively fail to  resist them, objectification -- dehumanization of women into both 'attractive' and 'unattractive' or 'repulsive' objects, the first both rewarded and imperiled; the second imperiled in different ways -- women will simply be reinforcing the system.)",1.

12/5/2017 2:06:38,"False allegations of sexual harassment are sexual harassment. 

I was very surprised to be informed- in 1995, on a January Monday at 1:15 p.m.- that I was accused of two years of “ongoing and increasingly worsening sexual harassment” and that there was a request I be expelled from the school, this from five fellow female students at a small Canadian college. I was to attend a meeting the following morning at 9:15 in the “Executive Meeting Room,” according to the short handwritten note on the envelope I was provided, with eight pages enclosed, including four pages of sexual harassment allegations, signed by the women, and four pages of either college rules regarding sexual harassment and/or college procedure on dealing with such issues. 

The next morning, as I was seated alone in the hallway terminus, five fellow female students were led by me, by a sympathetic college staffer, who looked like a helpful aunt with a collection of flower girls before a wedding, as four of the women were dressed in white, toes to shoulders. The college staffer led them to an adjoining room to the large Board of Governors Chambers. 
I was led into chambers about five minutes later, by a college vice-president, who pointed a chair to me, his back to me as he walked, without pausing or breaking stride, in a gesture I thought at the time like a duck hunter would point orders to a hound. 

Again, the allegations comprised four typewritten pages signed by these women, all student journalists, one student editor, one advertising manager, and one friend- which was a shock to my then girlfriend. When I showed her the allegations her face went so white her freckles stood out. We locked eyes, trapped in the surreal nature of it all, in one concentrated moment. 
I had read the first page only by the time the hearing began. I thought the issue was so bizarre I would attend the meeting the following morning to find out what was going on. 
The reason why my girlfriend was shocked upon reading the allegations is that she met this friend, ***, the previous November, just two months prior. On that occasion *** came to the newspaper classroom office where I was working late, alone, about 7:00 p.m., my girlfriend seated beside me, waiting for me to finish typing out some project. We were journalism students, after all. *** asked if I was familiar with the trades wing of the college. I was. She said she had to cover a trades show and didn’t want to walk there by herself, and would I mind walking with her. I said sure. Students have the option of asking security to escort, but a friend does in a pinch. When I got to the newspaper office door, I turned to my girlfriend and suggested we all may as well go down. It was a bit of a hike, the long corridor in trades did look dimmer than during the day. We quickly discovered the proper door, and it was a full trade show inside, Snap-On Tools with a truck and tool display, Bear Instruments, others, a agriculture combine with a pexiglass side so viewers could see its workings, plus coffee and donuts. Once inside *** went her way and we went ours, to take a look. 

Just over one week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers, *** came into the newspaper office, and exactly as before, my girlfriend was waiting for me to finish typing out a project and in exactly the same seats. This time *** was livid. The student editors, who chose which stories were printed, had met their 24-story quota for marks, as well as their lovers and close friends, but none of the other writers had, like herself. Without those published stories her final mark suffered. She invited me to a meeting where the writers were to confront the editors. 
I attended that meeting- by accident, as I had my first class in the room, and tired, at the end of the class with an hour free, I laid my head down on my desk to sleep when the room began filling up with writers and editors. 
*** sat on the floor. 
“I made it,” I called to her. 
“I was looking for you,” she said.
The room was unusual in that the desks were against three walls, creating a speaking well in the middle of the classroom, an unusual seating arrangement.
I spoke on behalf of the writers, earning the obvious wrath of one of the two senior editors, ***, who demanded to know why I was at the meeting, a rather odd question. 

That was just over a week prior to this meeting in the Board of Governors Chambers where *** sat beside ***, both of them dressed in white from shoulders to toes, demanding- this is not an understatement- my expulsion from the college, both citing, with three other students,  a long history of sexual harassment.
To say I was shocked is an understatement. Nothing came to mind. I could not fathom these women could tell an untruth. It was not a formulated thought of mine that they had lied. All I felt was this whole experience was surreal. 
The other three women were ***- I thought that was her first name for the longest time, like Mary Ann or Peggy Sue- but actually *** is a last name.  *** and *** were the other two. I’m sure after nearly a quarter century their last names have been all changed with marriage. 
*** was the only one of the five women who was not dressed in white. 
“Nothing of a sexual nature has happened to me,” she said. 
She told the committee she was there to support her friends and that she was a witness to many of the sexual harassment episodes. 

Interestingly, well after the hearing was done, when I showed the allegations to a retired city police inspector- he had taken up private investigating- the first thing he did after reading was tap the page with the back of his hand- where ***’s name was- and said, “She’s the ringleader.” Even then, right at the time he said it, I didn’t understand. It took a moment to fathom what he, with his long years of police investigative experience, could see in a moment. 
The allegations read out ranged from *** wrote I had rubbed my head on her legs- this was, apparently, immediately after that meeting of writers vs. editors. *** wrote I had asked her about her and her boyfriend, which, she said, were questions that were not of my business and made her feel very uncomfortable- this was part of a brief conversation about November or December, we talked sporadically as we typed. *** wrote I had leered at her leg “accidentally” exposed from the knee down-  I am not kidding here- and had also asked her out once repeatedly and she had to leave the room to end the requests- I had actually asked her what was happening in the Barn- the student bar on campus where liquor was served and musicians played- and did ask her if she wanted to go- and she, in turn,  asked her teacher boyfriend, who answered from the hallway, just outside the door, until then hidden from view, and she said they would meet me there. I ended up working late and didn’t go. *** said I had leaned on her leg while talking to her and this put her in so much fear she was afraid to leave the student newspaper office until I was well gone for some minutes. 
I was on my heels for the entirety of the hearing. It was too much to absorb. I was entirely unprepared. 
It was a bit like a police officer asking if you’d come down to the station to answer questions to get something cleared up, and instead, being escorted into a courtroom where the judge is waiting, the jury is waiting, the Crown Prosecutor is waiting, the allegations are presented, and after a 15-minute break you are told to defend yourself. 
Nothing came to mind. I rambled helplessly. 
That I had not been their fellow student for a year and a half as alleged never came to mind. I had been their classmate for one semester and three weeks, as I had graduated with my own class the year before , in April, and came back as a third-year student. 
That never came to mind. 

That I had worked late in the newspaper office with my own classmates, most of them female, ***, my editor, at least 20 times, late and alone, no problems, ***, a teacher of 14 years experience, about five times, late and alone no problems, ***, a former beauty queen, I’m sure 30 times or more, late and alone in the newspaper office, no problems, ***, once ’til 5:00 a.m., late and alone, no problems, the list goes on, ***, ***, others, if not late and alone, we worked for hours each day week in week out in our two-year college until graduation. 
That never came to mind. 
One member of the sexual harassment committee, the registrar, asked if me if anyone had ever felt uncomfortable around me before. The committee’s student member asked me if I knew it was wrong, why did I do it. I wondered aloud why the issue was happening so quickly, I just learned about the issue the previous afternoon. 
“I AM THE CHAIRMAN!” the vice-president bellowed, and I shut up about that, I thought I’d be kicked out of the room.
The women were not challenged by committee members on any item. Later I understood why. To challenge a victim on the truth of allegations is to revictimize them. That’s why I was challenged. But I was not prepared at all. I hadn’t yet even absorbed the impact of what was occurring. 
At one point *** said I had shown the allegations around the newspaper office- I had- and she wanted me “brought to issue” on that as by doing so I had disrupted their place of work and their safety. 
“We have to work there to do the work we have to do. He has disrupted it,” she said.

At home, a day or days after the sexual harassment hearing, I read the allegations for the first time. I discovered, then, for the first time, they were in the form of a petition. 
I called out to my girlfriend, “Hey! This was a petition about me!”
All these many years later it is hard to fathom the sexual harassment committee took ***’s complaint seriously, that I should be in trouble for showing a petition to students who worked in that newspaper office. I had shown about five or six female students while I sat in one spot. I really wanted to know what they thought of them. I was at a complete loss. So were they, it seemed. 
In the end I was found guilty, expelled from the college, and would only be allowed back with the permission of the college president, the two-vice-presidents, and the dean of student services.
There was no appeal permitted. 
I did write the college and ask about their appeal provisions, later, on the advice of a lawyer, who grinned broadly when the answer came back that there was no appeal. With that meant we could proceed directly to Court of Queen’s Bench. 

To make a long story short, I won in court. I returned to college just shy of one year later, in January 1996. 

A female student journalist in the new second-year class asked me for an interview about what I’d gone through. She suggested we go into anther room for the interview. We walked into the very room where, almost exactly one year before, that writers vs. editors meeting had taken place. She likely would have known nothing about it. She would have been a first-year student then. 
The room looked exactly the same. The desks were in the exactly the same place, against three walls of the classroom, creating a speaking well in the middle of the room. 
It felt surreal. As she asked questions I ignored her, walking from desk to desk, putting my hands on the desks, incredulous. It was as if I walked into a time tunnel, suddenly transported back one year before the sexual harassment hearing, before the court process. It was as if I had been transported back in time to the last place where things made sense. 
I didn’t sue for money. I just wanted the decision of the college overturned so I could continue my education. 
I returned to the college and lasted one semester. Those looks of disdain I had from the communications staffer and that receptionist were rife in the college They were everywhere. I was untrusted and the talk of the college. I felt so uncomfortable I let go of my plans for two additional diplomas. 
I’ll leave it there.
","I was a student in a community college. 
","Classmates. 
",Small Liberal Arts College,"Lethbridge Community College. It's name has since changed to Lethbridge College. It was a community college for vocations and trades, not really a Liberal Arts College, but that's the closest description, above. ",Print Journalism ,,As above. I should add one of the points I won the case on was that the college violated the Individual Rights Protection Act. After I won my case the college revised their sexual harassment policy. All mention of the Individual Rights Protection Act was removed from the new policy. ,"None. They were treated quite well, with every sympathy. After I was expelled one was quoted in the student newspaper, saying, “It will never end. I sacrificed a big part of myself.” So they played victim to the end of their time in college. And beyond, but I'm getting word count warnings, so I can't add much. Interestingly, our photography instructor dropped by, weeks after the hearing, months before the court date, and informed me *** had, the previous semester, gathered a number of female students together to give him negative teaching evaluations. So her assembling female students together to jeopardize my future at the college wasn't the first time she had done such a thing. It was the second time. ",No idea. ,"Not entirely sure. I am very untrusting now, even all this time later, extraordinarily so, even of friends. I am still rather stubborn. I get very upset with obvious injustice. That may be a good outcome. On the downside I do have a lot of 'Why bother' moments. I first felt that after the hearing, deeply, for weeks. It was all so surreal that at times just getting off a chair and crossing a room seemed absurd. Why would anyone walk across a room? Why would you do anything? Why would you plan for anything? It was as if suddenly discovering birds never flew, they walked on sidewalks while carrying luggage, and people parked cars on their sides, trees never had leaves, the sky had always been green and grass purple, and people ate on rooftops burning money to keep their plates warm, and everyone acted as if that was normal, and only to me it was all making no sense. That is the best way to describe how surreal it was. That feeling hasn't completely left, as it still comes back from time to time and it's been almost 25 years. That's a considerable downside. It's energy-sapping. I should add my girlfriend at the time ended up in the hospital over this. It seemed information overload. She was in hospital a few days. The nurse had given her a glass of orange juice and my girlfriend, after the nurse left, wanted it watered down. It was too thick, she said. I kept watering it down and she kept tasting it, asking me to water it down. In the end it looked like water. She said it still tasted like syrup. That broke me. I nearly gave up fighting. That was a big 'why bother' moment. It was too much. Entirely too much. I'm not sure how I recovered from that moment to continue to fight. I nearly gave the whole thing up then. ","I graduated in print journalism. I still write. I did write a book about this issue back then. A well-placed college staffer told me I would not win in court, that I was trying to push over an apple cart. So that's what I called the book, Pushing Over the Apple Cart. I split the book in three volumes and never did publish Book III. Book 1 is free. Kobo sells it as an ebook. This isn't a plug for the book, it's just more or less answering the question, above.

12/4/2017 19:33:18,"I was attending a week-long academic event I had helped organize that was held in conjunction with an incredibly large national event in 2016. We invited Lester Spense to be our keynote speaker for this event, and I was incredibly excited to talk to him about his work since I respect it so much. The first day I met him, I was excitedly talking about a new book that had just come out, and how it intersected with his work and my own when he interrupted me and asked ""Do you have a partner that helps you with this?"" I was confused and hurt, and responded ""um, absolutely not. I do all of my own work."" He replied ""I'm trying to ask if you're single or not, that's all."" I didn't know what to do since I was shocked for several reasons: one being that he is very public about his marriage and his children, and two, because I was caught off guard. This was the first of many incidents that week with him. I kept trying to keep my other male-identified friends around me, but they also did not understand what the big deal was. I told the group at one point ""Lester Spense keeps trying to sleep with me,"" and my ""friend"" said ""awesome, you should do it!"" I was heartbroken, because once again, they didn't understand what it's like to never be asked about your work, but instead treated like someone who is just there to have sex with. On the last night of the event, LS text messaged me on my phone (this is how I found out one of my male friends gave him my number), showed up at the bar we were at, bought me a drink (which I did not drink), and told his ride to go on home without him because I would take him to where he was staying. He lied to me and told me he was getting divorced. I told my friends I didn't want him in my car, and the other event organizer said ""god dammit just take him to xxx's house."" So, that man's friend rode in the front seat of my car while Lester Spense literally pouted in my backseat because it was finally clear to him that I would not be sleeping with him.

I confronted him by saying that I thought he would want to know that grad students were buzzing with gossip about his exploits and the student he was sleeping with at the time would come to class and tell people all about what they had been up to. When I spoke to him, he looked and the ground and said, ""Thanks"" -- then he cut me off professionally, never to speak to me again. He  broke up with this particular student shortly after my confrontation and used my name *while he was still inside of her* in a post-coital ""this isn't working out"" move. He would go on to sleep with several other students while I was in school (and after). This behavior established a value system that confused the metrics for ""good work,"" created competition between women that had nothing to do with the program or our education, and normalized predatory behavior. Of course he has been promoted several times and never held accountable even though his antics are widely known. 

2011: My advisor commented on my breasts in a meeting about my thesis. This was part of a comment  he was making about why he didn't understand that the professor who slept with students was seeing/interested in a friend/colleague of mine who, according to my advisor was less attractive than me ""because [my] breasts [we]re so much larger than hers"".

Of course this means that he harassed me, too. We were together for about six months when he moved to the east coast to attend a PhD program from which he was expelled for groping a woman's genitals at an off campus party. Because they were both in the same PhD program, she was able to levy charges.

During this time of crisis, he turned to me to perform the emotional labor of supporting him without revealing all of the details of what had gone down. After a couple of years, he moved back to where I lived and began adjuncting at the institution where we met. Not only did the faculty support him during his suspension (he reached out to the professor who slept with students to ask for advice), but they hired him back to work in their department knowing fell well of his transgressions, the charges filed, and his 'fall from grace' in the PhD program he moved across the country to attend.",What does this question mean?

He was much more careful in how he spoke to me in public; interestingly, my dean had no trouble with (making sure that?) the perp was on the faculty evaluation committee when I went up for tenure. The perp made sure to make ""off handed comments"" around me about the power he wielded on the committee so that I was terrified about my prospects for tenure. I was worried that had I spoken up officially or gone to HR at that point, there would be gossip that I was not qualified for tenure and that this was my way of gaming the system (not true) or that I would be detested for going against everyone's favorite good old boy and that that would also lead colleagues to think I was not ""collegial."" Either way, it seemed to me that I would lose by speaking up. So I didn't do anything but ask the provost that I hoped my application would be fully read and vetted by more than just one or two people on the committee.  She assured me my application would be read thoroughly and I did receive tenure.

He would discourage me from eating lunch with my boyfriend and harass me when he noticed we were hanging out together. In a private meeting he said to me ""I know you're always coming in late because of you and your boyfriends extracurricular activities,"" referring to having sex before coming to work. It's a long and awful story really but long story short, he harassed me until I broke up with my boyfriend and moved closer to lab. He threatened to fire me every day unless I did whatever it was he was wanting me to do- cancel my vacation time, sleep in lab. ""If it were me, I would have slept her until the results came out. How can I make you care that much?"" When I stared to fight back and stand up for myself, he lied to my committee about me misrepresenting my work in order to have me dismissed from the program. I fought this using recordings of conversations and other evidence of the emotional abuse and after threatening to sue, the assistant dean of the graduate school intervened and made a pathway for me to stay in the program but I was already at my wit's end and decided to leave anyway which likely saved my life. I had worked so hard to get my PhD from this #1 program and he had me wrapped so tightly around his finger that I nearly attempted suicide. After I left, three other women in my lab left without the PhD they came there for and I do not doubt it was because of this PIs inappropriate behavior. I still suffer from PTSD and associated issues from the 2 years I spent being abused by this man. The worst part is that even though he lost 5 students in five years they still awarded him tenure (I was one f his first students). In this particular program abuse is not only the norm but is encouraged because his fellow professors (all white men) only encouraged his behavior and when I tried to reach out for help, they discouraged me from seeking help even from a mediator who would help our meetings.

12/4/2017 14:29:09,"Bear with me. I'm shocked at how long ago this was and shocked at how immediate the pain can still feel. I'm not sure when it began, but if it had begun obviously, then it might have been avoidable (or so I am telling myself). 

This begins in the late 1980s and continues through the 1990s. The perpetrator was a history professor at my undergraduate and graduate institution. I took two classes from him in successive semesters in a subject that I had been dying to study from a professional since I was nine years old. At the end of the last semester, upon finding out I was about to graduate, he asked me to lunch in the faculty restaurant because, he told me, he always took his graduating students to lunch. I thought nothing of this, including the fact that I was the only student at lunch since this was December graduation, and was flattered. 

About a year or two later, after a major depressive breakdown and recovery, I had decided that I wanted to go to graduate school and become a historian specializing in that field. I went to talk with him about pursuing a degree. He recommended a number of good schools, but said that the best was right there at the University of Houston, studying with him. I look back on it now and laugh at how naïve I was. I actually believed him that it was a good idea to study colonial Native American history at University of Houston with a military historian who knew nothing about Native Americans. (He has, of course, in the past decade co-written a book about Native Americans in the American Revolution. That was my dissertation proposal. Not that I had a monopoly on topic, but still.)

Now, understand that no one had told me that the school should offer you funding or anything like that. I knew nothing about graduate school. He did not enlighten me. So, when he said, ""stay here,"" I thought nothing of it and was a bit relieved because that meant I could continue to live at home and cut down on expenses since I was going to be paying for this out of my own savings and perhaps loans.  Had I better advice, I might have applied to a better program with someone who had better grounding in the specific area that I wanted to study.  

Likewise, the semester before I defended my master's thesis, the semester in which most master's student would be applying to a doctoral program if they were in my position, other students asked me where I would apply. I didn't know that I should, which was when I learned that three degrees from the same school, especially a place like UH, is not the best career plan. I asked a couple of other faculty about it, and they told me the same. So, I went to him for advice. He grew furious and demanded to know who would dare tell me this. Meanwhile, he was doing all he could to help a male graduate student apply to Cornell and Columbia. That same student he helped get funding to travel to archives for his master's thesis but told me that I did not need to go to archives for research. Another professor said that he would never pass a master's thesis if the student had not gone to an archive and, although that professor would have been a perfect person to sit on my committee, my harasser would not allow him to sit on it for that reason. 

Up to this point, I've only been describing the unethically bad advice that this person gave me. The sexual harassment part is almost laughably mundane and cliché. It began with meetings at lunch time. Could I meet at noon? Oh, hey, it's lunch time! Am I hungry? Let's go get something to eat at the faculty cafeteria. He'll pay. Oh, it's crowded. How about off-campus? That sort of thing. Then, he wanted to meet after class, which ended at 9 pm. He'd close the blinds, although we were on the sixth floor. He'd shut the door. He'd want to meet in his ""secret office"" without windows. His shoulder had a cramp, could I rub it. How about his back? Here, sit on his lap. Really! Sit on his lap. Suggestions about my clothing, about the way that I buttoned the top button on my shirt, or that my skirts were so long, or so short, or that I didn't wear heels, or did. Complaints about his wife and the way she didn't understand him. Complaints about how much he did for everyone and was never appreciated -- ""all I get is a dick up my ass,"" was the way he put it. I'm not kidding.  He even gave me a box of chocolate kisses on Valentine's Day and said that he hoped it was full of orgasms.These things came gradually, in a crescendo, moving me from student, to friend, to confidante, to -- I don't know -- schoolyard crush in our interactions.

At the same time, he issued steady reminders that, if I did not accept the role, there were consequences. Those comments about being unappreciated contained stories that seemed to me veiled threats. For instance, he said that one student had not thanked him sufficiently in the acknowledgements of his thesis and therefore he would not help that student in job searches or other recommendations in the future. In another instance, he had learned that another, female student (who was quite pregnant at the time) has passed her comprehensive exams. He called her into his office and said something like ""let me give you a hug in congratulations."" According to him, she backed of. He said that one move told him that he disgusted her and that he was never going to help her with her career, write her a letter of recommendation, or get her dissertation published. So, this told me that I was supposed to publically praise him and allow him to touch me or he would not do the things an advisor was supposed to do in helping a student. Other little micro threats like this cropped up constantly in his disparaging of other students and faculty. 

Meanwhile, as my advisor, he made sure that I took classes only from him unless absolutely necessary, then only from junior faculty who would not contradict him. He had me do independent studies with him, working on a project as his research assistant, with the promise that the project would result in a publication. Yet, somehow, at the end of the semester, each time, the publication would not materialize because he would have to ""put the project on the back burner,"" and I would not have advanced much in my own research or education. I later learned that this was his modus operandi for his targets, simply to keep them from taking classes from other professors while also earning the requisite number of credits.

Two incidents happened when I knew that I could not deny what was going on. The first came one summer, during the last of those independent study classes. 
There was a weird incident involving a long-time, disturbed graduate student who had submitted an epic poem instead of a dissertation and certain aspects of this poem could easily be interpreted as death threats on the lives of several faculty members, including the harasser. The harasser took to meeting students at a restaurant just off campus frequented by police. That is, until the time came for my meeting. Then, he decided that he had been there too long and was too regular in his movements. He had to throw the would-be assassin off. He wanted to meet at this restaurant elsewhere. 

As I got out of my car in the parking lot and headed toward the door of the new restaurant, the harasser got out of his and said, ""hey, how about over here?"" He pointed to an unmarked door under a stairway on the side of a the building. Meanwhile, two people got out of separate cars in the parking lot, looked about, joined one another, and went in that door, as if perhaps they shouldn't be. ""There's supposed to be a bar over here that the graduate students go to,"" he said. I reminded him that I didn't drink and that I'd rather go to the restaurant, but he went over to the door and walked in. Like a sheep I followed him. 

The only place to sit was on sofas. He pestered me to order alcohol, although he ordered a non-alcoholic beer. I only ordered a Diet Coke. He kept moving away from the subject of the research project and skirting towards sexual topics. I was wearing walking shorts (down to my knees, it was Houston in the summer, after all), a t-shirt, and a long sleeve shirt as a jacket. He suggested that I loosen up and show off a bit more, then he reached over and moved my outer shirt over and peered down at my chest.  I covered myself up and said that I was fine just the way I was. His whole demeanor changed. He was clearly insulted. 

More than that, after that incident, his evaluation of my work, my intelligence, my abilities altered drastically. No longer was I a promising student making excellent progress. I was now lazy and without an analytical mind. He demanded that I take my comprehensive exams three semesters earlier in my program than any other student and before I had finished my coursework, otherwise, he said, I'd be lagging behind and he could do nothing for me. 

The second incident took place when I decided on a dissertation topic. I brought it to him, but it quickly became apparent that he did not want to talk about the topic. He wanted me to grovel to him. He told me that, if I were to continue to be his student I would have to do everything he said, not just taking the classes he said and following the instructions that he issued, but that I could not date, I could not have friends that he did not approve of, I could not talk to people who me did not approve of, and so on and so forth in a litany of control that astounded me. I knew that I had to get out of there no matter what. So, I told him that I would be finding a new advisor. I had no idea what I was going to do, but I walked out the door, down the hall, into another professor's office, and begged him to take me on, which he did, to his own peril. Shortly thereafter, I lost funding, and the harasser was and had been for many years the head of the committee who allocated the very limited t.a. positions. 

I later found out many things had been going on behind the scenes. He had ensured that one of the graduate students whom I was dating lost his funding. He golfed with another graduate student and engaged in all sorts of locker room talk about me on the links. He would tell other students or faculty that I was a flake and not very bright. He told me that he wrote a critical evaluation of me, but when I saw that evaluation it was not critical. He threatened other faculty away from me when he saw me speaking with them. He threatened my second advisor when my second advisor tried to advocate for me. When the entire committee decided to reinstate my funding, he went into an apoplectic fit until they relented and did not. The glowing acknowledgement that he had intimidated me into writing he then used as evidence that he could not have harassed me. He told people that I ""showed up"" at lunch time to trick him into taking me to lunch, when he had made the appointments, and otherwise painted me as someone with a poor sense of boundaries.  So, all while he was telling me that I was brilliant, he was telling everyone else that I was crazy and stupid.  When I found that out, that's exactly what I felt. 
",Graduate student,"My graduate advisor, a powerful, full professor in the department.",R2,University of Houston (which is now R1),History,,"First, other faculty and students told me to get away from him, find another advisor or go to another school. This was difficult because he had isolated me and undermined my confidence in myself and because other faculty did not want to incur his wrath. I did find another advisor, which entailed a change of specialization on my part. This new advisor had much less influence in the department or field because he was early in his own career. He ended up caught between his own fear of the harasser and defending me.  Fortunately, an allied department hired an older, more powerful faculty member who was able to maintain independence and who was happy to take care of me as a student. Meanwhile, when I suspected that the harasser had been retaliating against me, ensuring that my funding (t.a. position) was revoked and preventing me from securing any other funding, I filed a complaint with the Affirmative Action Office. The policy of that office was to interview me, distill my complaint into a one page memo, allow him to respond in as many pages as he needed (he took fourteen,  single-spaced), weigh the two, and decide if there was a case to pursue. As you can imagine, they decided ""no case."" The acting head of the AAO was interim when I made my complaint and, before his response came in, she began a little investigation that turned up at least two prior instances that resembled mine. By the time his response came in, she had been replaced with a permanent head (a man), who said that none of the information that the interim head had discovered could be used because she had not followed procedure. So, my case was filed away under my name but not under the harassers, as was their policy at the time. This was twenty years ago, and I've done quite well in spite of him. The best revenge is success. Still, I feel rage at all of the wasted emotion, the time lost to the migraines, the mental energy and hating myself. I resent the waste of my self. Plus, the damn school still can't address me as ""Dr."" when they ask for alumni donations. ","The closest to actual consequences that he suffered came first, when he was removed from the committee that decided graduate student funding after I filed the complaint, and, second, when he applied to be dean. A friend of mine worked for the head of the dean search committee. He asked her about the harasser and she mentioned the complaint I had filed. The search committee chair went down to the Office of Affirmative Action to take a look and found not just my file but, so she said, others. He was axed from their list. Otherwise, nothing happened to them. He's still known as the department harasser, even by others who have their own reputations as harassers. ","Well, obviously I would have gone to better graduate institutions had he not given me such colossally bad advice in the first place. Who knows where I might have ended up had I studied under an actual specialist at a better university where they had some basic ethics in graduate education? That said, after twenty years,  I've gotten my revenge through success. This wasn't always the case. I had to change advisors, twice, and I had to change fields, after already choosing a dissertation topic that could not translate from the early modern era to the nineteenth century. I lost funding, which meant taking on part-time jobs in addition to adjunct work in order to pay the bills and to pay the full tuition because teaching assistants also had a tuition waiver. I did not trust the advisor that I ended up with, nor really anyone at all by then, and therefore did not develop the sort of professional relationship that would have benefitted my early career. Because of that, I took a detour into library science that did little but put me into debt and teach me that I am, in fact, a historian and must rebuild a historian's career several years out of grad school. I have only recently earned tenure at age fifty, when I earned my PhD at age 33. The explanation for that, and the better answer to this question comes with the answers to the next two, because my mental health and the choices that I made that affected the trajectory of my life and career were direct and indirect consequences of this harassment. ","I am naturally depressive. I was in therapy and taking Prozac before the harassment, but doing very well, so well that I thought I did not need it any more. Because of my improvement, I had made the decision to go to graduate school and to become a historian. I had developed a sense of myself as smart -- maybe not brilliant, but capable and an intellectual. I respected my harasser as a scholar, and his cultivation of me as his student made me feel more confident. When I realized that his interest in me was prurient, that he called me ""flaky"" and ""an idiot"" to other graduate students but said I had ""great tits"" and wanted to ""see what's under that top button,"" that he wanted to help my male colleagues go on to better doctoral programs but became infuriated when I asked if I should be doing the same thing, that he would ruin my career if I didn't let him touch me, then my whole sense of my intelligence, analytical ability, judgement, and future collapsed. 

During this time, I ended up in not one, but three successive abusive personal relationships, tried to join the Army as an escape (they rejected me because of the Prozac -- thank goodness!). When I lost my funding and then realized that my second advisor was at risk because of his association with me, I became suicidal and began cutting myself. Throughout, I had migraines roughly twice a month, bad ones that lasted several days in a row. Then, the shame. Oh, the shame would not end. Shame for getting myself into that in the first place. Shame for denying it for so long. Shame for not reporting it the minute that I knew that it was what it was. Shame and guilt that, in not reporting it, I had left some other woman vulnerable. Shame that perhaps I was the only one stupid enough to have fallen into that situation. Shame that I was sure everyone who did know thought I was crazy or asking for it or blowing it out of proportion. Honestly, writing this down now, I don't know how I got through it except for those fantastic therapists at the student health and counseling center, more Prozac, feminism, and making friends with a new cohort of graduate students.","This one is complicated because I don't want to make it sound like this was a good experience. It was awful. Yet, as Carrie Fisher said, ""take your broken heart and turn it into art."" I was a naïve, middle class, white girl with almost no understanding of the way power works. The whole experience cured me of that, from the way he used his power over me and over people associated with me to the way that people on the margins of my story had to judge the cost of tangling with him to the way that the institution protected itself in the process of reporting to the way that I myself became tainted by the harassment not only as it happened, but after and since. Someone told me that I can never charge someone with harassment again after this because then people will think the problem is with me, not with the harasser. That is patriarchy. 

Thus, the experience brought me to feminism, and feminism taught me compassion with marginalized people in ways that I never explored. That influenced my scholarship and put me in contact with some amazing people I might otherwise have missed, so I'm a better historian than I ever would have been under his alleged tutelage.

 But, I was also so very jaded by academia, just completely disgusted. If I could have done anything else and still been a historian, I would have. In fact, I did try. I finished my PhD simply because I felt I had earned it through grief but they don't give it to you until you finish your dissertation. Then, I didn't look for a faculty job. I was just trying to figure out my next move when I found a document editing job, which was great. That boss was awful, harassing in a different way, but I was also ultra-sensitive because of my prior experience. When we lost funding for the second time in four years, I got a library science degree, but discovered that I was too much of a storyteller and researcher of my own interests (rather than others') to be happy there, so found my way back to the academic world via community colleges.

 Now I'm at a liberal arts college. I also got my dissertation published, wrote a short, touristy book, and an academic trade press book in the meantime, all because I wanted to rather than had to. I found my own voice, but all in spite of the harassment. I could probably have done more in my life, and in a straighter line had I not been so angry and bitter and consumed shame. I'd probably be closer to retirement, for sure. I'd be further along, and maybe with more options in this uncertain academic environment. 

Twenty years offer many contingencies and the historical context has changed. Young women coming up have so much more facing them that, if we transplanted my experiences to today, I don't think that someone in my position could really recover from them. The environment in academia, regardless of gender, is too unforgiving of anything but a straight trajectory that the slightest wobble can devastate a career.

Here's the thing: it never really got worse than this, but only because I got lucky and because I did a lot of work to keep our relationship 'professional.' It started out with him being flattering (saying very nice things about my mind/intellect) and progressed to him inviting me to meals where he would pour his heart about his own failing marriage and make suggestive advances. As this was happening, he gave me a few academic perks (a chance to publish in his journal, participation at a conference he was running) that were useful for my career and which I was happy to have-- though I was always hesitant to take these things and eventually started to say no. At the time I was sad for him. He was very lonely, up for tenure, and clearly under a lot of stress (he is now department chair). As I look back from the safe distance of nearly a decade of time, I feel really sorry for me-- that at a time when I should have been fully absorbed in my writing and gaining confidence in myself as a scholar, I was managing a faculty member's odd sexual pursuit. I ended up graduating a year early and was fortunate the leave the city where he was and not come back. I never told anyone but my husband (who was my husband at the time). I just wanted it to go away. This man made a point of telling me how special I was and I didn't actually see him doing this to anyone else.

The sexual violence of academia can seem to be its own thing, but I think it is inseparable from academia as a rigid power structure in which very few (usually white, usually male) people have essentially absolute control over the careers and well-beings of a larger group of (usually younger, often female, often economically precarious) people.

All faculty members of the committee were members of the honor society. Committee members were to be paired in teams to evaluate a stack of applications. After our first committee meeting, a tenured professor (about 40 years older than me and from another department) complimented my ideas in front of the whole committee and requested to work with me specifically. At the time, I was excited to be 'chosen' by a faculty member and to receive recognition for my ideas. He invited me to sit in on one of his undergraduate lectures and meet with him afterward in his office to discuss our committee obligations. In our conversation, he asked me about my research and I shared information about my project (and the fact that my project was informed by a personal experience of reproductive loss) . He told me that he *knew* he sensed something *different* about me, but presumed that I had been sexually molested. He then put his hands on my upper thigh and started caressing me. I almost overlooked the fact that he was touching me because I was so horrified and self-conscious thinking that something about how I conducted myself at the first committee meeting gave him the false impression that I had been sexually molested. In retrospect, I now that he was fishing for information and testing the waters with me to assess my vulnerabilities. And I know now that I was targeted by him, which is why he specifically asked to work with me in a team. But at the time, I completely internalized blame for what was happening and thought that I must have done or said something to give him this impression. Regrettably, the approach that I took to dealing with his unwanted attention was to continue working with him in a team and 'prove' (to him? to myself?) that I was capable, confident, in control, and NOT ""damaged"". All that resulted in was more situations where we were alone together. The whole experience was gross and inappropriate. I want to be 100% clear that I do not think that victims of sexual violence are ""damaged"".

I believe he was moved, and recently I suspect he lost his job, as he was hanging out in a coffee house M-F during work hours","None, really.","At first I was in a state of disbelief and anger; I still am. I was amazed that, at age 45, I would be sexually harassed at my workplace, somewhere that, until earlier this year with the Tristan Retkke civil rights intimidation, I’ve always felt very physically safe, very protected because of the regular training everyone at ETSU receives regarding diversity and harassment. I took one or two days off work to process the experience because I was unable to focus on my work. I decided to report this to the Office of Equity and Diversity because I understand the psychology and personality of people who sexually harass; they habitually offend because of their sense of entitlement; plus they’re usually allowed to repeat their bad behavior. I don’t want XXXXX to sexually harass any of our students, staff, or other faculty. I feel like I’ve dealt with this fairly well, but I know that others are not as well-grounded as I, and I wish to prevent anyone else, particularly our vulnerable students, from suffering due to XXXXX’s callousness and illegal remarks. 
This was not the first time I was sexually harassed in my workplace (this happened in 1992). The harassment this October triggered flashbacks of the earlier physical sexual harassment that I experienced, as well as a resurfacing memories of the negative and cursory attempt of that workplace to investigate the claim, which the company failed to take action on. The 2016 harassment has had a significant affect upon my emotions and my physical health. 
Until that day I’d consistently come to the CPA 5, 6, or sometimes 7 days a week, to exercise. Since then, motivation for pursuing my health goals has plummeted and I’ve gained 5-10 pounds because I’m not exercising consistently. That may not seem extreme, but taking each of those pounds off was a struggle and a reflection of very hard work at the CPA and attention to nutrition, which has also slipped, as I tend to eat as a stress-response. Every time I come to the CPA I consciously avoid going near the Freshens area or catching XXXXX’s attention. When I can, I time my workouts within the small window when the Freshens smoothie area is closed. Instead of being a safe and welcoming place, the CPA has very negative associations for me. Up until October, I’d never felt unwelcome or out of place at the CPA. The permanent staff of the CPA, student workers, and people using the gym—staff, students, faculty, etc. create a supportive and welcoming environment. The CPA was my happy place and I relished the time I spent there. I’m very upset that my exercise regimen has stalled because of XXXXX’s verbal harassment of a sexual nature and inappropriate comments about my body. 
Besides building muscle and cardio conditioning, I use visits to the CPA as a means for controlling my stress. Going everyday made a dent in my stress. Now, going once a week, or once every two weeks, is not controlling my stress. In fact, it creates anxiety for me because I must be hyper-vigilant about not attracting any harassment from XXXXX or other people. It’s irrational because I know that everything I do at the gym is perfectly normal and within regular expectations of types of exercises. Further, my attire has always met and exceeded the dress code suggested for CPA gym-goers, but since XXXXX’s comments about my body and weight, I am anxious and motivated to conceal as much of my person as possible. 
While I made an initial inquiry about filing a complaint in October, I’ve delayed making a formal, written complaint because reliving the experience by writing about it, and then describing the affect it’s had on me, is unpleasant. Analyzing how it’s distressed me will make me dwell on it for days and disturb my mood and emotional state.

12/4/2017 10:50:00,"In 2014-2015, a female colleague and friend (then a graduate student) became involved in a secret, polyamorous relationship with another female graduate student and a male adjunct faculty member. Technically, this relationship was in violation of the university's sexual conduct policies, as the adjunct faculty member taught in the graduate students' department. The relationship turned unhealthy when the male partner began to play each of the female partners against each other. Ultimately, my friend (who also lives with bipolar disorder) despaired and committed an act of self-harm. Though she recovered and remained active in the program, my friend's action brought the previously secret relationship to the attention of other graduate students in the department. However, my friend's female and male former partners both actively sought to maintain the relationship's secrecy by harassing and threatening other graduate students who inquired about the relationship and/or offered my friend support. The former partners successfully recruited some graduate students to their ""side,"" which created a stilted he-said/she-said/she-said dynamic. My friend, out of a combination of fear of drawing further departmental attention to herself and of potential reprisals from her former partners, insisted that none of this behavior be reported officially. At the time, I agreed out of respect for her wishes; I have come to regret this decision. In the end, the events were an open secret, as the entire graduate student body in the department became embroiled in the affair. One graduate student -- who bore the brunt of the female and male partners' harassment and bullying because of her advocacy on my friend's behalf -- left the program the following year.",Graduate student,"One graduate student, one adjuct faculty member",Elite Institution/Ivy League,,Theater and Performance Studies,,"None, as it was never formally filed. When I encountered repercussions from one of the former partners (see below), I sought advice from departmental faculty members. They offered emotional support and some advice on how to proceed, but there was no official response. Both faculty members with whom I discussed my experiences shared some version of the observation that the graduate student scenario mirrored their personal experiences in faculty meetings and that bullying was rife throughout academia. Perhaps unsurprisingly, as victims of such behavior themselves, they did not offer any clear-cut solutions, only (much-needed) emotional support.","None. The graduate students remained in the program, and the adjunct faculty member returned to teach courses the following year.","The year after the events (2015-2016), I became the graduate student representative in my department. Though the events were never pursued through any formal complaint or through any public forum, they continued to structure a great deal of graduate student life in and around the department. The female graduate student/harasser identified me as someone who supported my friend (which, admittedly, I had), and therefore treated me with open hostility in meetings. This behavior increased in severity throughout my tenure as representative, and boiled over around a policy proposal that I put forward over our systems of self-governance (the proposal was that all positions be elected democratically, thus ending the unilateral selection processes that were then in place). Over two months, I received threatening emails and ultimatums to retract my proposal prior to our democratic vote on the topic. Departmental politicking ensued in which two camps appeared, both of which mirrored the ""sides"" that had formed in response to the prior year's harassment. During the meeting, the female student/harasser and one of her close allies voiced accusations that I was abusing my power and that I was targeting them personally. They refused to permit others present from discussing the proposal, and they insistently returned the topic of conversation to their accusations and their grievances. The female student/harasser's side carried the day, having convinced (or intimidated) enough of the other graduate students to vote down the proposal. It strikes me as deeply ironic that my colleagues elected to democratically refuse the prospect of more democratic processes. Moreover, it strikes me that the scenario is a textbook case of projection, in which the female student/harasser accused me of carrying out a vendetta against her through departmental politics as an explicit justification for her vendetta against me.","For the remainder of the 2015-2016 academic year, I was in something of a state of shock. I avoided campus as much as possible. The following fall, I began to experience symptoms of anxiety when I would commute to campus. When I was on campus, I would avoid my department as I did not want to encounter the female student/harasser or her primary ally. Ultimately, I sought out a month of counseling on campus, but I did not find that very helpful as it required me to come to campus for sessions. Ultimately, I threw myself into my work and made my priority the completion of my degree and finding a job elsewhere.","My graduate program typically lasts 5-6 years. Though I was able to obtain funding for a sixth year, I chose to complete my degree in five, largely because of my desire to remove myself from an unhealthy environment. I was fortunate in that I was able to land a job right out of my graduate program, which has allowed me to move on from these rough three years. However, the experience has alerted me to the ways that harassment stems from broader systems of abuse, how it operates systemically and reaches far beyond any originary event, and how not everyone makes it through such experiences as smoothly as I have. The silver lining (if there is one) is that I have become much more alert to patterns of harassment and abuse in the world around me.","Thank you for taking the time to assemble this information.

There are two parts to this:  what I heard, and what I personally experienced/observed.  

What I heard was that he was a creep and a lech who used office hours to get undergraduates in his office and onto a couch-bed he kept there; that the departmental parties at his house were ""wild"" and involved drinking, drugs, some nudity, and sexual harassment of women students who attended.  The class I took was not the only class he taught.  He was said to have taken pictures of his wife on the toilet, and to have shown them at some of these parties.  There were specific instances given which, 45 years later, I can't recall clearly enough, but I was told that some women dropped a class, or even dropped out.   I do remember being warned that he liked to use the ""You're not a prude, are you?"" mode of persuasion (this being the early 70s, it worked on too many young women.)   And he had a habit of locking his office door if the student gave him a chance.

What I observed:  In our lab sessions (when we dissected flowers under the microscope to identify the species) was that he liked to roam around ""helping"" students, and often touched them on the back or shoulder; the male students got a pat; the women students got a squeeze on the shoulder and he was clearly looking down their fronts, not at the specimens.  We had graduate student T.A.s, both in the lab and on the field trips (out to various sites to collect native plant material for identification.)   I found it easy to avoid touch in the lab and on the field trips, and did not attend any departmental parties at his house.

What I experienced:  I was an older student, with a history degree (Rice U.) and military experience behind me--and I was married.   Also I was then tall and very fit, less than a year off active duty.  So although I was propositioned and lightly insulted, I had been forewarned and also had resources he would not expect.  It did not affect me as much as it would have a younger, more vulnerable person.   I needed to ask him a question about an upcoming field trip and went to his office during office hours.   I stood back from his desk, between him and the unlocked door.   The setup in his office was as described: a low bed against the wall to the left (he had a big office, as befitted his academic rank)  covered in a quilt, with pillows making it a plausible couch, with a bead curtain in front of it, held back partway on the sides.  Very harem-inspired.  He  got up from his desk and approached, suggested that I ""get comfortable"" on the couch so we could discuss the field trip.   I declined.  He said ""You're not a prude are you? What, you think I might attack you or something?""  I said ""No, I'm married,"" and he immediately said ""You're not going to let that stop you..."" and did the raking head to toe survey with a long pause at my (then small but not invisible through my shirt ) frontage.  ""And I'm an ex-Marine,"" I said, giving him a firm look.  He puffed up and changed color and I repeated my question about the field trip schedule (one had been re-scheduled due to weather) and he answered sounding angry.   I left, convinced that the rumors I'd heard had been true, and that if I'd been younger and without the military experience, I'd have been struggling to get out from under him.  It stuck in my mind over the years particularly because so many upper-division undergraduate women and graduate student women passed the rumors about him.",Undergraduate major in the department,"Senior tenured professor, much published, widely known in his field.   ",Other R1,University of Texas at Austin,Biology,,I did not report the incident;  I hadn't been physically assaulted and would have had no idea how to report even if I had been.  ,"None.  It was clear he was highly prized by the department.  If the institution was aware of the rumors, his reputation as a botanist protected him.","I became much more aware of sexual harassment (instead of the steady anti-female bias I'd faced all through school) and when I went into grad school a year later chose a female thesis director.   Other things impacted my career more, including the still-strong bias against women in science, the constant gaslighting, and some medical issues completely unrelated to the harassment.","Immediate: despite having been warned I found his behavior shocking as well as unprofessional.   I was determined to stay away from him after that, and became more suspicious of other faculty and grad students, and long term more cynical about men and their behaviors to this day.  But that was not the only incident (like many women I'd had previous incidents, starting in childhood.) In total, the various incidents and the anti-woman bias and gaslighting definitely affected my confidence, my ability to concentrate, my trust in both men and the legal systems supposed to protect us from predators.   This particular incident actually gave me confidence, in that I had ""done the right thing"" of situational awareness and a firm response to his attempts.  Overall, though, it 's just one bright spot.  ","Cumulative affect of harassment, including this, was to make me less able to compete, more likely to just walk away from conflicts and opportunities that seemed too good for me.  Looking back from the age of 70+, I know I have sabotaged myself both by not reaching for the prize, and by going full-on Marine when it wasn't the best strategy...and I know where the sudden crevasses of confidence come from.  But I still fall into them.  I had once dreamed of an academic career, but by the time I left graduate school short of a graduate degree, I had realized that it was far from the safe haven I'd thought when I was a bookish girl.  instead I'm a moderately successful novelist doing wildlife management and prairie restoration on the side.  (My graduate work was in ecology.)   Married (made a success of that--48 years), one adopted son.   Could I have made a success of an academic career if no harassment had ever occurred?  Probably.  I was smart enough, energetic, willing to work, eager to learn (still am eager to learn) and got along with many kinds of people...though not with some.  How much of that is due to how I was treated, I don't know.  ","Other forms of abuse related to gender but not overtly sexual reinforced the sexual harassment--not just for me, but for other girls and women I knew.   Attacking a woman's confidence in her sanity, her intelligence, her ""drive,"" her appearance, etc. erodes the sense of self as a worthwhile individual.   For me, it has been the combination of attacks that's had the long-lasting effect...It was like trying to run up a greased staircase.  If you took the hard classes anyway, studied hard anyway, avoided the obvious traps (drinking, drugs, illicit sex) you could still be clobbered for being plain, badly dressed, having the wrong skin color,  being a child of divorce (a club I was beaten with all through school), and told that any or several of these things proved you'd never succeed, never get out of the low box you belonged in.  And the pretty, well-dressed girls could be dissed for being ""party girls"" and ""not really serious"" about their education, or (in college) that they'd slept their way to their grades.   I know this questionnaire is just about sexual harassment, but I had to bring the rest up.

Instead of discussing my thesis, he wanted me to read poetry to him leisurely on his couch, and slowly began to try to touch me in ways that made me feel uncomfortable. He would schedule our appointments around 8 at night after his other office hours were over, and during the last appt I had with him, locked the door with a key (which I believe locked both sides of the door). During that last appointment with him, while we sat on the couch, he ran his hand down my arm and then caressed my waist, and then asked for a hug -- putting his face so close to mine that I sensed he wanted to kiss me. Ultimately, because I stopped communicating with him, he did not provide substantial comments on my thesis -- sending my main thesis advisor only one line of dismissive text to comment on my paper. I now know two other women who have experienced harassment from this professor.

I wrote out a detailed account in 2011 to send to the Title IX officer of what happened (this is copied and pasted from the email I sent her April of 2011):  
Feb 23, Wednesday
7:30pm-8pm
-invited me to sit on the couch with him; he said “Office hours are over” and closed the door
-sat closer than necessary to me on the couch
-complimented my appearance; said “You have a nice sense of style.”
-says that he ""likes"" me often
-casually asked me to tell him “about myself” around 7:45 after going over poems
-asked me to come back the following week
-asked for a hug after our session

March 16, Wednesday
7pm-8pm, Office hours
-invited me to sit on the couch; sat closer than necessary to me on the couch
-asked me where I had been; said it was a long time since he last saw me
-expresses often that “he likes talking to me” or that he “likes” me
-asked me if I was going to be around for spring break (the next week), as if I could come meet with him then 
-says that he likes talking to me
-he said ""he would love to spend all night reading poetry with me"" but he ""had to go""
-asked for a hug afterward, which involved more body contact than necessary

April 11, 2011
Monday. ~6:50pm-8:15pm, Office hours
-He made it known to all students waiting when I arrived for Office Hours that he would “save (My name) for last,” and asked some students who had been waiting for a while to come back some other time. Met with only one other student very quickly before me and then met with me.
-He closed his office door. He sat on his couch and invited me to sit down also, and then he sat in closer proximity to me; often would touch my arm/elbow for longer than a second
-He turned off the light, and the door was locked from the outside. I know this because he went to talk to someone he heard in the hallway and then came back and had to unlock the door.
-After we discussed poems until around 8pm, he said he wanted to ""stop work stuff"" and then asked me about how I was doing and I told him I had developed a repetitive stress injury; he was overly sympathetic and suddenly leaned in close to me and ran his hand slowly down my arm, starting from my shoulder. We both quickly pretended like nothing just happened.
-Later, after he told me about his trip to the east coast, he began wrapping up our conversation, and, while still sitting near me on the couch, he asked for a hug. Although I did not want one, I was afraid to say no so I did not protest. He made it longer and closer than necessary and his left hand touched down my side and waist and lingered. I just turned away very quickly as soon as I had moved away and averted my eyes and he had jumped to behind his desk and continued conversation as if nothing had happened.
-He asked me to meet with him again before I was gone/post graduating so that I may say goodbye
-He told me he really enjoyed our sessions, and so I told him our sessions were ""helpful,"" and he said if they were ""merely helpful"" then his “feelings were hurt.” I did not respond
-He talked about how he ""tailors his pedagogical relationships with his students to best fit their needs"" as if to explain what was happening and then began talking about ""transference"" in an indirect way
-I felt very shocked and uncomfortable afterward; told three people close to me right away and my main thesis adviser within a week

12/4/2017 7:57:10,"When I was 19, I took an introductory English major course taught by a tenured male professor.  I learned throughout the semester that the professor had a poor reputation because of his stringent guidelines and arbitrary grading practices; but I was unaware of his history of sexual misconduct with students--until I became the target of that harassment.  Though some of his comments throughout the semester were off-color, I tended to ignore it.  But, one day, I wore a gray dress to his class, an anomaly for me as I favor pants and more casual clothes.  The dress set him off.  He exclaimed that it was nice to see me dressing that way; but that he wished I wore more colors (I tend to dress monochromatically in blacks and grays) and that, given my complexion (I am Mexican-American) I would look particularly good in pastel colors.  He then proceeded to derail class discussion in favor of polling my classmates about whether or not they thought I would look better in pinks and purples and more lady-like clothing.  If they chose not to answer, he forced them to.  Many of my male classmates eagerly participated.  I remember explaining to him that my sartorial choices were based on my disdain for traditionally feminine colors and that, as a former dancer, I'd worn enough brightly colored dresses to last a lifetime.  That was the wrong thing to say.  He became enamored of my past as a ballerina, a fascination that continued when he enrolled his young daughter in a beginning dance class I taught in town--a class that I taught while wearing a leotard and tights.  Though he did not harass me at my workplace, his snide comments on my appearance and clothing continued in class.  For instance, I wore a bandana in my hair one day (think Rosie the Riveter) and he told me I looked like a ""feminazi"".  Because I had to deal with him long after I completed his class (because I taught his daughter dance), I was always on guard.  The last time I heard from him, he messaged me on my personal Facebook page (we are, obviously, not Facebook friends but have mutual friends on Facebook apparently) to explain that he is ""proud of me"" for my accomplishments as a graduate student.  As if he had anything to do with that.

12/4/2017 7:55:06,"I was attending a summer classical music festival with peer professionals. We were all considered ""fellows"" - not staff and students, due to a wide range of ages. Some participants were post-doctoral and nearly the same age as staff who are professors back home. We were there to create new music together as composers and instrumentalists. 

My instrument group - saxophonists - happened to be comprised of some of America's top performing individuals, so I was excited to collaborate and even bond with them while in Italy. 

However, being the only girl, I often felt left out. I would go to dinner with them in the evenings, but they would spend this time talking about their sex lives. Not just open, healthy sex talk - talk ALWAYS defined by women being stupid, objectified, and/or demeaned. I cannot emphasize this point enough. Perhaps I was prude - I don't believe so - but even if I weren't, this was not healthy sex talk. 

Example: ""This girl at a party made a racist statement toward me, but it was okay because I got her drunk and she showed me her boobs. So who won? Me.""

""This girl was so stupid. She thought I wanted a relationship, so I let her think it until i'd had enough sex, then just stopped texting her.""

Worse still was the constant explicit commentary on staff members' bodies. Two of the women staffing the festival were my professors back home, both modest, respectable, and world renowned in their fields. Comments I heard regularly were ""I wish I could see up her skirt when she bends down"", and ""I'd pee in her butt."" You heard me right. This kind of stuff is hilarious to these guys, but it's so non-consensual on the part of the women! They are there to be respected! The men staffing the festival have none of these problems at all. 

Also, as a woman, I could literally break down how respected and listened to I was based on whether or not I wore makeup. These were sweltering days in Italy with no breeze or ice in drinks, so I often skipped makeup to avoid itchy skin. Male peers literally ignored me when I spoke. When I wore makeup, they listened intently without processing what I was saying. 

Lastly, there was an evening where I was with these male peers on a mission to buy a bottle of wine. They told me to ""flirt"" to get a discount. The wine shop owner was a bald middle-aged man. I jokingly said I would, but when I turned around, my friends were gone and I was alone with this man. I actually got scared and emerged - drunk from our earlier dinner - only to be made a total fool in front of professors while my peers told my staff I was drunk and flirting. I had actually been quite scared.

I hated this experience. I paid way too much money with hopes of ultimate professional collaboration in a dream setting, my first chance meeting fellows from the nation's top music academies, only to have this define my experience.

12/4/2017 7:31:08,"Where to begin?! 

I am choosing to include a professional music festival in the definition of academy because I attended for work purposes to collaborate and bond with peer musicians. 

I met a friend and collaborator at a professional music festival in the summer of 2014. The following summer, he contacted me saying he would be passing through my part of the country; he lives in New York but had a residency in Wyoming, just an hour north of my tourist destination in Colorado. He asked if he could sleep on my couch for a weekend and sight see. I happily obliged. We were encouraged by our festival staff to stay in touch for collaborative purposes, and he and I had worked on a new music commission together previously. 

Rather immediately after I drove an hour to pick him up from his residency, he made small talk about sex, which made me uncomfortable. But I thought, we are supposed to be peers, friends, mature adults... If he feels like discussing his sex life, I'll accommodate him, but I won't discuss mine. He emphasized his open relationship with his girlfriend back home. Without wanting to feed my own ego, I kept fighting the nagging feeling that he was discussing this to set us up for a hook up later. 

The day went on with dinner and other sight seeing, and all the while I felt inexplicably uncomfortable. 

That night, I tried to be a basic, good host by putting on some Netflix. I sat on the opposite end of the couch. I could feel him inching closer. Before it could get more awkward, and all the while doubting he'd do anything and that I'm just assuming he's coming close because I have an ego, I got up to leave. I said, ""I'm going to bed. Do you have everything you need?"" He made me feel weird - ""Is something wrong? Why did you get up all of a sudden?"" I told him nothing, just tired, do you need anything, etc. I went to bed. He then made loud noises - absolutely slamming cabinet doors, knocking wine bottles over, uncontrollably high from his local souvenirs. 

I returned to the living room to ask ""Is everything okay?"" He took this as me wanting attention from him, rather than me being perturbed that he's so loud and disrespectful. ""Why do you keep checking on me?"" I told him he's being loud, and my roommate - a young cousin of mine who I'm protective of - is trying to sleep. 

This happened twice more. 

After going to bed a third time, I heard him knock on my door and whisper my name. He tried to enter. I got up to greet him - ""What do you need?"" Rather than answer, he said ""Why do you keep asking me that? Do you want to hang out?"" I told him no. He tried to enter many more times that night. I slept with a can of hair spray. 

This grey area was so uncomfortable. This was supposed to be a friendly weekend hosting a professional peer on my sofa, but the following morning, I lied and told him I had too much graduate school homework to focus, so I paid for him to get an Airbnb and stay somewhere else. 

I asked friends for advice. Some said that simply by turning on Netflix I led him on. I highly disagree. I know I was a bit cold and professional. Others said this was inexcusable. This was supposed to be a professional peer. Why did this happen? Anytime I see someone who resembles him, I actually get scared.

12/4/2017 7:24:39,"There is one man I know who has a terrible reputation for inappropriate behavior among almost all of the women who know him.  In my last two years of graduate school, I became a member of the same society of fellows that he belonged to.  This fellowship invites its graduated fellows back once a year, so I see him every year that I attend.  He is now a tenured professor at a respected university.

It is hard to explain how insidious this man's actions are.  I first met him in my first year of graduate school, when he briefly dated a friend of mine.  He was extremely full of himself, and when I saw him now and then at school events, he was one of those awful men who made long-winded comments in the Q & A.  But I really only got to know him when I was inducted into the fellowship, and he targeted me.

Every year, he has this habit of identifying the newest, prettiest women, and he follows them around flirting/insulting them.  At the fellowship meeting that first year, as I asked this (married) professor for advice about the job market, he would sprinkle in little comments like ""If only I had met you earlier...""  I was initially flattered, but over time I began to see that it was a ritual.  The last time I attended, he (and a few other senior male colleagues) latched onto a beautiful graduate student.  When he is in this predatory mode, he will come over and put an arm around your shoulders or a hand on your waist.  He will get in your personal space, and treat it like a game when you try to rebuff him.

I graduated, moved on to my postdoc, and one year into it, he became a visiting scholar at the same institution.  In fact, he was put at the next desk over.  He was always leaning around the partition to bother me, and there was always a sexual undertone.  This is where it gets harder to pin down though.  The only specific incident that I can remember is when we were talking to a couple of other people and I said something about a box, and he gave suggestive look a look and said ""Your BOX?""  It was things like that.  Always bringing it back to sex, when we were in our WORKPLACE.  And then when it was about work, such as at my public lecture, he would tell people behind my back about how unoriginal my ideas were or how unconvincing my argument was.

I complained about him so much that after I left the postdoc, my boyfriend (now husband) encouraged me to unfriend him on Facebook.  That was liberating, even though he made comments about it at the next annual meeting.

I knew I wasn't the only one who felt this way (the mere mention of his name often elicits an eye roll), but I was surprised when a friend at another school brought him up this fall (pre-Harvey Weinstein).  She was a graduate student a few years before me, and she'd had the same experience.  We had been talking about inappropriateness from male colleagues in general, and she said something like, ""Well, you-know-who is the worst.""  I suddenly though, Yeah, isn't it a problem that all of these women have felt threatened by him?

I know you will hear much worse stories, but this type of sexual harassment is completely pervasive and undermines our careers.  It is men treating women as sexual objects rather than colleagues.  It doesn't matter what you wear or how you act.  These men perpetuate an uncomfortable atmosphere for women, make us insecure about our self-image and our accomplishments, and have the power to pass on their opinions to others.","graduate student (Penn), then post-doc (NYU)","senior fellow in my graduate fellowship (Penn) and professor at another institution, and then visiting scholar (with tenure I believe) at my postdoc (NYU).

12/4/2017 5:01:17,"In fall 1971, my sophomore year, I enrolled in a class taught by an African American male faculty member who had a reputation for sexually harassing female students. As I was  African American and his previous targets had all been white, I assumed I was safe. Around midterm, he insisted I was too advanced for the topic he’d assigned most of the class for a final paper and would need to meet with him in private to devise a topic for me. I knew that “private meetings” with him had been occasions for various forms of browbeating and manipulation for other women. Thus, I spent the remainder of the semester insisting I was too busy to meet with him and begging for a paper topic. Finally, realizing that if I failed to write a paper because I had no assigned topic I could be flunked, I explained my dilemma to another (legitimately) advanced student and asked her to share her topic with me, adding I would do my own research and inevitably produce results different from her own so there should be no question of plagiarism. She agreed. I thoroughly researched and carefully wrote my paper, vowing not to complain as long as the professor gave me a grade of B or above. Less than that and I felt confident my complaint would be taken seriously by the committee on faculty conduct, as I was a well-known, well-liked student with an excellent academic record who was also one of the leaders of the campus black student organization. The professor had been brought up on sexual harassment charges the previous year, but managed to elude censure by painting himself a victim of racism—a claim that would be much harder to make in my case. I received a B for the course, so felt no need to take matters further. The following semester, however, the professor flagged me down one day in the Student Union. He was seated with the girl who’d shared her topic with me and her boyfriend, another of the prof’s advanced students. The prof proceeded to inform me he’d been so impressed by my term paper that he wanted to meet with me to discuss the possibility of collaborating on its publication. At that point, I loudly informed him I was no longer his student, told him exactly what I thought of him and marched off.","Second year undergraduate, not planning to major in the professor’s field",Tenured faculty,Small Liberal Arts College,,The class was in music history; my major would eventually be literature.,,None sought,None,Taught me that sexual harassment was about gender not race.,"It was extremely upsetting at the time, though I was able to vent, strategize and get moral support from my roommate and several other women students in whom I confided.

12/4/2017 1:37:19,"Too many individual incidents to recount so I'll focus on one: In grad school a professor made multiple inappropriate comments about women in the women's history class she was teaching. All the students in this relatively small class were women. Most were straight, some were queer. The professor self identified as a lesbian, and would talk about her sexuality in mildly inappropriate ""joking"" ways in class and in office hours to ""test the water"" with individual students, even though she was in a committed long term relationship. She would often ask us about our sexual relationships with other women, and if two of us talked to each other outside class and she saw us, she'd assume we were sleeping together and would question us about it. The worst remarks I recall her making in class were when she joked about ""pimping us all out,"" going so far as to name the nearby street where she envisioned turning us out as prostitutes. Most of us laughed nervously, a few people rolled their eyes or murmured in protest. She pretended these were ""just jokes"" but it was clearly giving her pleasure to abuse her power in this way--she enjoyed making us feel uncomfortable. She harassed the straight women in class incessantly. When she found out I was queer she backed off a little on me--I think she was afraid that if a queer woman reported her for sexual harassment it would have more weight. She didn't harass the other out queer woman in class much either.

12/4/2017 1:31:23,"I had an emotionally abusive relationship with my dissertation advisor that ultimately involved sexual harrasment.  All throughout my time in the program he would alternate between extravagant praise and career-threating criticism (like failing me in my qualifying exams and not accepting chapters of my dissertation), and with every conflict I would seek to end the relationship and ask  my second reader, a woman, to direct my dissertation instead. She would always refuse because she thought it would ""look bad,"" and intercede with my director, and the next round would start all over again; I would be the golden child until the moment I was totally inept and wrong and had no business being in a doctoral program. The roots of the dynamic all became clear to me when I came out as transgender and transitioned male-to-female in 1992 right at the end of my graduate program. I had been afraid that if I came out too soon my advisor would find a way to deny me the degree I had worked so hard for. Even though I had started living socially as the person I considered myself to be about a year earlier, and was taking hormones, I was not out in my doctoral program. I finished and filed the dissertation under my old name/gender, and the second I was notified that the degree had been award I went back to my committee to have the title page amended to reflect my new name. I got the other two signatures first, then went to my advisor's house to have him sign it as well. I decided that a quick approach was best. When asked what I needed, I said simply ""Let me cut to the chase. I'm transsexual and changing my sex. I need you to sign a new title page for me."" I already had pen and page in hand, handed him both, and got the signature before he had time to really process anything. But as soon as he signed, he started literally panting and grunting with emotion, and said ""Ugh, umm, ahh, I...I have long considered you a rather attractive young woman."" He asked me if I went to sex parties and did party drugs and if so could I maybe invite him some time or score something? All the years of emotional whiplash became instantly clear. He had been hot for me but because he understood me to be a guy he hadn't come on to me, just punished me for being the object of his repressed homosexual desire, but now that he could consider me a woman, it was suddenly ""hey baby how 'bout it?"" He offered me money ""on retainer"" to buy drugs. I took his money, walked out of the room, never spoke to him again, never asked him for anything let alone a letter of recommendation, never tried to publish my dissertation, never tried seriously to get a job in the academy until I had built up a new field of expertise in another discipline--that took me another seventeen years.  Being inappropriately sexualized by a person in a position of power over me totally affected my life and career-path. I've always been reluctant to share this story publicly, mostly because the conflict didn't involve physical contact, just emotional twistedness, and would be just a she said/he said thing.

I worked for him as a teaching and research assistant. In thanks for my hard work, he took me out to dinner at a restaurant well beyond my means. As a private pilot, he also, for ostensibly other reasons, took me out for a day in his plane. I was too young to know how to decline or to determine whether I was making too much of his advances. I was quite alright, in the end. He never forced the issue and remained supportive of my work and career until his death. It was less of a physical attack and more of an emotional toll too heavy for a young academic worrying about her career, her status, appropriate responses, image in the department, real motivations, etc. In context, this mentor was a serial husband. He had 7 marriages by the time he died. I am quite unscathed, in the long run, and he was a very good mentor otherwise. But, I learned a lot that has prevented me from being in situations that would have likely turned out quite worse.","I was a graduate student (Masters/PhD). It was in my first & second year that these events occurred, but I continued to have interactions with him for the remaining 4 years that made me uncomfortable.","He was a famous figure in the field, a full professor at the university.  He was a mentor/supervisor, in charge of classes and research projects I had been assigned to, though he was not a supervisor/member of my PhD committee. His work was in a tangential discipline for which I was qualified and often assigned as a teaching or research assistant. (More money, fewer candidates) He was about 20 years older than me.",Other R1,,Arts,,"Did not formally report it. I did solicit advice from my other supervisors and mentors (all male), and the resounding response was support and sympathy, but also a kind of eye-rolling acknowledgement of ""he's at it again"".

I do have a mental illness that was diagnosed at the start of our interactions, and it contributed to the problems I was experiencing. Also, the conflicting support/sympathy for my situation co-existing with dismissal of his actions left me confused and distrusting until I could find my feet.","Not really much for trajectory; perhaps the opposite. His positive mentorship has led me to an excellent position in my field that combines my primary discipline with his. As mentioned above, it was also a learning experience. So, in terms of life choices, I have definitely learned that academic opportunity is not always sufficient excuse for putting myself in compromising situations. And, it also makes me quite close to the other men in my life who have been mentors and supportive and have never remotely indicated that there was an intimate interest.","I recognise that the story here is not, by far, the worst you're going to see.

12/3/2017 23:30:20,"So I began Undergrad as a joint degree student in tech theater and linguistics. By spring of my first year, I was the youngest assistant stage manager in the dept’s history attributed to my prior experience, enrolled in 22 credits (mostly theater), and basically in the department 9-12 hours a day/6 days a week. Because of my involvement in the show, the other faculty in the production also had my personal contact info (phone, room number, etc.). The stage crew director (faculty member) began texting me seemingly innocent enough about show related things, but it quickly escalated to pressuring me to spend time with him outside of work related things. He also taught one of my classes, and would come up behind me and rub my back. I would shake him off and he’d come back the next class. He touched other girls too, rubbing their backs. I was 17, having started college young, and I was glad to be in this show and out in a big city on my own. But I did know his actions were wrong. I first told a senior in the department how uncomfortable he made me, and she said he had a reputation for that behavior and she would try to watch my back and deflect him. That worked for the physical touch but didn’t stop the texts and calls at night. I kept saying no. Finally grades came out at my marks were far lower than any contributing assignment’s marks would have led me to anticipate. I had been a high school valedictorian (weighted). I was pissed. I went to the show’s director in tears and asked how this could happen (showing high marks consistently on grades). He told me he didn’t believe in grades anyway and that if I cared about my grades, this department wasn’t for me. He didn’t acknowledge he objective discrepancy at all. I spoke with the female department chair and she said (and I’ll never fucking forget it): “you’re young, sure, but you can’t honstly tell me you didn’t know what you needed to do to get a good grade from him!” I walked out sobbing while she laughed. I left the major and didn’t look back. In the two years that followed, many of my friends from the department shared similar stories with me, and nothing changed. Finally, in my final year, one of my close friends from the theater dept became Miss Maryland and was on the TLC show and became a local celeb, especially for the small college where I was. She had been harassed by him consistently and raised the issue (using her newfound platform) to the university level administration. Within the semester, he was gone. The next semester spring before I graduated I was funneled into a 1:1 advising meeting for competitive graduate scholarships with a memeber of the university president’s office. I told her why that one semester’s grades were so bad that it took me from summa cum laude to magma cum laude (basically killing any chance for these kinds of scholarships). Her response: “well if your grades were that important to you, you should have left the dept when you thought the teacher would jeopardize that.” I’d been in performing arts for almost a decade by the time I started college, and I have never done it since. I loved our school, but the whole experience was a huge black cloud. Oh, and as if that weren’t enough, I was in ***’s book like almost every other girl I knew. I didn’t remember the interaction with him that led to my entry in his journal. But I think the university’s whole non-handling of that situation was pretty egregious. I’ve been very lucky in grad school off and on in the last 10 years, nothing like this has ever happened again.

12/3/2017 22:16:34,"In my final few months of graduate school, my dissertation chair invited me to his hotel room while we were at a conference to talk about my work... moments into our ""discussion"" I found that he was taking his pants off and wanted sexual intercourse. I feared that he would no longer support me if I went against his wishes. At the same time, I worried that people I respected, including my committee members, would denigrate me and my work if it were known that I had had sexual intercourse with him. I took on the situation as my own psychologically, and continue to suffer deep emotional trauma from this experience. 

I later ended up working with this same professor post-graduation on a major research project, and while I had made clear that I was not interested in any sexual relationship with him, he proceeded to engage in aggressive sexual harassment and sexual assault in his role as my supervisor. Once I settled into the job, he began to routinely grope me at work. He put his hands on my breast and/or genitals whenever he could manage it. He regularly commented on my body, shape, size, and sex appeal. He has verbally and physically threatened to rape me on several occasions. At each meeting with him, I anticipate I will be subject to some sort of sexual abuse or public ridicule because of my gender, but he is my supervisor, letter writer, and a giant in my field. 

This harassment is on-going and while I want to file a complaint with my university, I have been told by many colleagues and other women he has abused that the university does not care about me/us; it will always protects its cherished professors.

I am anxious and depressed and withdrawn from my colleagues. I have started to look for other career options despite having started off with significant promise in my field and a strong desire to continue my scholarship. ,"Too much to capture in words. Shame, humiliation, self-blame, guilt, insomnia, anxiety, panic attacks, depression. I have suffered repeated miscarriages, and have other significant health issues that are continuing and are directly related to the stress, anxiety, and emotional suffering that has resulted from this sexual harassment and abuse. ","Incalculable. It is the single defining situation in my life -- career and otherwise. I pray that others are spared this agony. 

I was the first in my immediate and extended family to attend college. My mother cleaned houses and my father was a construction worker who never finished high school. Education became my path to freedom... or so I had anticipated. I worked full time throughout college in order to finance my undergraduate education. It was a miracle that I was accepted to graduate school at a top research university on a full scholarship. This predator took advantage of my vulnerability -- as he put it, ""when I first met you, I knew I could do whatever I wanted to you."" 

Both my parents were absent from my life and I had no family support for what I was trying to achieve as a scholar. I was alone and vulnerable. I wanted to be seen, to be told I was smart, to be encouraged in my research, to be given an opportunity to become a professor. He strategically gave me all of what I longed for -- for a limited period of time, and just long enough to get what he wanted. He told me that I was his most brilliant student, I had so much potential, he wanted to help me succeed -- and then he took advantage of our relationship by coming on to me while I was his student, and later by sexually harassing me as his employee.  

But this is what happens to people like me in the academy -- the marginals within the ivory tower. We are subject to predators like this-- and sadly, the institutions that we depend on to protect and educate us, fail us entirely; instead, these elite institutions offer us up as a yet another perk to their full professors who have everything and nothing to lose. 

From this experience, I have learned that my life is less valuable than that of a sexual predator simply because he is a full tenured professor (whose achievements, by the way, are owed to the women that he has used to co-author his papers, teach his classes, and ghost write/edit his work and grant proposals, not to mention also the significant unacknowledged domestic labor of his wife). I have learned that if I complain, I will find that my job is suddenly without funding, and other colleagues in my field won't support me. These are terrible lessons to learn-- and I pray that someday they won't have to be learned by anyone because they won't exist anymore. 

The only way to ensure that this kind of exploitation and abuse stops is for universities to take sexual harassment seriously -- ZERO TOLERANCE -- to fire the perpetrator (tenured or otherwise) AND those in the administration and faculty who protect them. It is time for universities to protect the vulnerable in the community so that the university can be a space for EVERYONE. Until this happens, nothing will change; victims will continue to fear the loss of their jobs and reputation, and will continue to be too afraid to speak out.","The only way to ensure that this kind of exploitation and abuse stops is for universities to take sexual harassment seriously -- ZERO TOLERANCE -- to fire the perpetrator (tenured or otherwise) AND those in the administration and faculty who protect them.

He was switched out of my lab but remained in the large lecture I had to attend twice a week. I was told by Title IX to come late and leave early as well as sit in the back of the lecture hall so as to not be seen by him.

12/3/2017 16:59:33,"My final year of graduate school I--a queer woman of color--was getting strong flirtatious signals from a faculty member--also a queer woman of color. This was someone who I had been attracted to for several years but I never, ever entertained the idea of having a crush on her, let alone pursuing a relationship with her. At first I thought it was all in my head: “there’s no way that this woman is flirting with me, am I insane?” (In hindsight, I can now see how head games were a central component of the manipulation that would follow). I had had a particularly rough few years in graduate school, which included an antagonistic working relationship with one of my committee members and messy boundaries between myself and my dissertation advisor (who I frequently offered emotional and logistical support to as she endured a personal crisis of her own). I think that the dynamics I had with these two other faculty members contributed to me being in an unusually precarious and vulnerable position as a grad student, which is why I found it exciting and flattering to have a faculty member shower positive, flirtatious attention on me. 

I somehow got it in my head that I should ask her out on a date. To my surprise, she said yes. And that was the start of what would turn out to be an extremely tumultuous relationship that lasted about a year, followed by another year of emotional abuse. While the relationship started out great, magical even, it quickly became volatile and emotionally abusive. It would take me a long time to connect the dots and realize that I might have been preyed upon. For example, long after the relationship ended I was looking at an old text message exchange we had before we had even gone out on our first date. In the text exchange she mentioned that she was trying to ease her conscience by reviewing every email she had ever sent me (before I asked her out). Naive as I was, I asked why she would do that. She replied by saying that she was trying to see if she had been unprofessional at any point (i.e. if there had been any written evidence of her flirtation). She concluded that the emails showed that she had just been warm and supportive, and proclaimed: ""So it’s on you.” Later on I would learn that I was not the first student that she had had a relationship with. She had dated another student at a previous institution. And the MO was the same: he had asked her out. I suppose “it” (the responsibility? the transgression?) was on him, too…

After a tumultuous year-long affair, she broke up with me and I was utterly heartbroken. This also coincided with me taking a postdoc on the other side of the country, which has lead me to endlessly wonder: did she dump me because the relationship was toxic and that was the benevolent thing to do? Or did she dump me because I wasn’t willing to sacrifice my career so that I could stay near her? There was a brief attempt to rekindle things long distance, until out of nowhere she ghosted on me.  At the same time, her phone would (mysteriously, conveniently) butt dial me every week for about 2 months. When I confronted her about it in a text message, she gaslit me and tore me a new one. This is just one example of the kind of catch-and-release manipulation that characterized our interactions. ",ABD and in my final year,"Faculty member and had just been granted tenure. But did not serve in any direct position of power over me (i.e. was not on my committee, I never took a class with her, etc.). ",Other R1,,Humanities ,,n/a,Unknown,"This person has made things difficult for me at professional conferences that we both attend. For example, shortly after the ghosting/gaslighting/tearing of a new one, I was attending a major conference and talking with two junior colleagues/peers when she approached our group and began to loudly and enthusiastically engage with both of my colleagues while completely ignoring me. It made me feel small and invisible. I was so uncomfortable and upset by this that I excused myself and abruptly left the scene. She proceeded to do something similar at another conference we both attended several months later. This behavior feels territorial and like she is trying to bully me out of the way. ","This relationship and its aftermath have been extremely damaging to my mental health. She said and did things that not only crushed my spirits and messed with my head, but also crushed my intellectual and professional confidence. It’s basically been the equivalent of pouring gasoline on the imposter complex flames. I really thought she loved me. And maybe she did. But in the end, love doesn’t matter. What matters is respect, and she demonstrated over and over again that she had none for me. ", I am currently in a contingent position and on the job market (again). I oscillate between wanting to drop out and leave academe (which she would sometimes subtly suggest I should do) and wanting to get a prestigious tenure track job at an elite R1 as part of my desire to prove her wrong about all the negative things she said about me. Outcome still TBD. ,"I have spent months obsessively thinking about what transpired between me and this person. I have been reluctant to name it as harassment because I am aware that the stakes are quite different in this scenario. Naming a queer woman of color as a sexual harasser or predator has far greater stakes and implications than does naming a cishet white man. I don’t want to demonize this person, I don’t want her to lose her job, and I don’t want any of this information to be used to further devalue or disrespect her and her labor. For what it’s worth, I still care very much for her and hope she is able to find some solace in this fucked up world we all live in. 

One of the ways I have been able to come to terms with the trauma of that relationship has been to intellectualize the power dynamic. I know that she has also been the victim of harassment and abuse (both inside and outside of academe). In the context of heteropatriarchal US society and an extremely hierarchical system like the US academy wherein women (especially of color and queer) are devalued, manipulated, and abused at every turn, it is not surprising to me that someone might choose to exercise power in whatever scant ways possible. I’ve seen it over and over and over again wherein marginalized faculty (even the ones who we respect for their social justice scholarship etc.) lash out at or take advantage of grad students in various mental, emotional, and sexual ways. For example, I previously mentioned the messy boundaries I had with my advisor as I helped her through a personal crisis. That crisis was exacerbated by the university's complete lack of human regard for and callousness toward my advisor as she endured the unthinkable. As a person of conscience, I could not idly sit by and watch that crisis unfold, so I did what I could to help in whatever ways I was able. But in hindsight, I also realize that I may have done those things (unconsciously) because it was my first year on the job market and I needed my advisor to do some basic things, such as write letters of recommendation, and, you know, *advise* me during a time when she could very well have gone AWOL. 

Anyway, this is all to say: graduate students have become repositories for all of the academy’s dysfunction. Some faculty treat grad students like punching bags through which to exercise their own angst, and many graduate students are so insecure and/or neglected to such a degree in their programs that they mistake the punching for support. None of the people mentioned in this narrative are evil. Sexual harassment and other forms of abuse in academe are not the result of one or two or even 500 bad apples.

12/3/2017 15:46:32,"Four instances jump to mind, but there are, of course, many more. 

Instance 1) An major figure in the field came to give a talk on campus when I was an undergraduate student (not even 20 years old) and was lured up to the man's hotel room with the promise of a signed copy of his book as a thank you for driving him around during the day as we hosted him. I was pushed up against the wall as he stuck his tongue in my mouth and  started kissing me and asking me to stay so he could show his appreciation. I managed to get away, and went back to my dorm room. Somehow he got my phone number and proceeded to call me all night long asking me to come back or to see if he could come to my dorm room. This person some 20 years later is known for predatory behavior, yet he and his lawyer are so quick with legal claims about defamation and libel that it has gone largely unacknowledged until recently when a critical mass of young (and no longer so young) women have started speaking out collectively. His colleagues consistently look the other way and play dumb.

Instance 2)  Predatory faculty member was dating graduate and undergraduate students. It was an open secret, except to those targeted by professor. Others did not warn students or punish faculty member. 

Instance 3) Also occured when I was in graduate school. I took an undergraduate class in my subfield on an interesting topic, and the professor made sexually inappropriate comments all semester long. His girlfriend came to a class film screening and he said he hoped we didn't mind if her head was in his lap during the movie. He also invited us all to a co-ed naked hot tub party at his house to celebrate the end of the semester. I went to title 9 and the party was cancelled, but he told me he knew it was me who ""ruined everyone's fun"" in front of the class. 

Instance 4) As a junior faculty member it was mentioned to me by senior women in the department that when a certain male colleague gets upset with women faculty he stops talking to them for a year, and that I should expect it to happen at some point. During my second year as a faculty member he took umbrage to a concern I raised in a faculty email chain and stopped talking to me. Meaning that when I was talking with another colleague he would walk up, pretend I wasn't there, and begin his own conversation with the other faculty member. Everyone in the department knew this was going on and now one did anything. When I shared this with the dean, she told me ""oh yes, well he is a unique character"" and provided no resources or understanding about how this created a hostile environment for me.

12/3/2017 14:06:57,"During the first year of my graduate program, I separated from my emotionally abusive husband and entered into a new romantic relationship with a fellow graduate student. I am a relatively private person, and as such, kept many of the details to myself as a way of coping with my impending divorce and continued emotional coercion and abuse from my husband. During that time, the fellow graduate students in my cohort (both male and female) bombarded me with questions about my separation and my new relationship, including intimate, detailed questions about my sex life. When I politely declined to share this information, members of my cohort spread malicious, speculative rumors about my sexual history and the current state of my sex life. These rumors not only circulated among graduate students, but also spread to members of faculty, including the professor I worked for as an R.A. Two male graduate students contacted my estranged husband to fill him on the rumors they had heard about my sex life, sparking an escalation of my husband's continued threats and abuse. The professor I worked for an an R.A. approached the graduate student I was then in a relationship with to admonish my partner for entering into a relationship with a ""married woman."" During admitted students weekend, rumors about my sex life were also spread to many of the prospective graduate students who came to visit the campus. Needless to say, my reputation as a slut, alongside detailed and highly exaggerated if not outright false rumors of my sex life persisted throughout the rest of my time in the program. New graduate students I'd never met approached me while drunk to say that they'd heard I was into ""threesomes"" or that they'd been warned off from talking to me because I might try to ""break up"" their relationships. After being given a desirable teaching assignment by our course coordinator, I found out the director of my graduate program had chosen to strip both me and my partner from teaching the advanced course. When I approached the director to ask why we had both been demoted in terms of teaching assignments, the professor claimed that she'd made the decision based on our relationship status. Needless to say, the explanation made no sense and was beyond unprofessional and inappropriate. Just before graduating from the program, I discovered that this same professor had, at one point, invited fellow graduate students over to her house, at which time she had engaged in spreading false rumors about me that she had heard from former students. When I again approached this professor about her unprofessional behavior, she claimed that she was not responsible for verifying rumors before discussing them with my fellow graduate students. ",Graduate Student,"Fellow graduate students, professor in charge of R.A.ship, director of graduate program",R2,University of Alabama,Creative Writing,,"Before I graduated from the program, I did speak to the new director of the program to make sure the issue was known. She was kind and sympathetic, and offered to address the complaint formally with the old director of our program. While I spoke to individual professors and students before then, I had not filed an official complaint, in part because I did not know doing so was possible and I feared even more retaliation on the part of fellow graduate students and faculty. ",None that I know of,"After my first semester in my graduate program, I mostly withdrew from any program activities outside of classes. When I did go to department sponsored events, I often felt uncomfortable and ostracized. I didn't apply for any additional department awards, jobs, or positions because I didn't think I'd actually be considered for them (in part due to persistent rumors at both the student and faculty level, in part due to the way I'd been demoted in terms of course assignments by the head of the program). I also failed to network with fellow graduate students. I still live with the persistent fear that rumors will circulate when I go on the job market in the future as some my former harassers are still very involved in the field. ","Untold. I essentially isolated myself for the duration of my program. I had very few friends. When I tried to address the issue of the rumors and harassment with my fellow graduate students early on, I was either given the cold shoulder or told I deserved what was happening to me. People I'd once considered my friends were willing to ruin my reputation and experience in the program because I wouldn't be forthcoming about my divorce or sex life with them. The impact of dealing with all of this while also attempting to get a divorce from an abusive husband was, frankly, devastating. I spent a lot of time crying. On a daily basis, I felt an exorbitant amount of anxiety and stress knowing that I would still have to interact with these students and professors both inside and outside of class. I still spend hours contemplating how things could have been different. I routinely blame myself. At times, the entire experience feels so shameful as to be unspeakable. I fear rumors will persist as I am still within the academic community alongside several of my harassers. I feel like I have to be the perfect student and the perfect colleague lest anyone in my current graduate program ever catch wind of old rumors and the cycle of harassment begins again. ","I trust people less. I do not submit to publications my harassers are associated with and also avoid going to large group conferences that I know my harassers will likely attend. I am wary of networking, as many colleagues I meet already know my harassers through social media and may even be friendly with them. That being said, in some ways, the entire terrible experience has made me stronger. I am more in touch with my mental health and don't sweat the smaller stuff. I am in a new graduate program with wonderful students and faculty, though I still fear that my past may come back to haunt me.

I simply got the hell out of that situation.  I recognize that this isn't an option for everyone and that not every aggressor takes the hint. At the time I was employed by a female professor from my undergraduate institution. She was and is a great mentor of mine. In ways I didn't quite acknowledge at the time, having a strong female role model who actively supported my academic goals allowed me to remove myself from a toxic situation. The job she gave me allowed me to earn money so the extra time it took me to switch advisors and finish my degree was less of a hardship, but I also lived in the knowledge that I could let one potential advocate for my graduate career go and that there was still someone behind me. "," I worked in the service industry for many years which and the unfortunate effect of raising my bar for harassment to really be assault, which is to say, it was fairly par for the course after many years of tending bar and cocktail waitressing. I rolled my eyes, complained to one or two friends and moved on. Its a bad sad to be so anesthetized.  I was also 27 or 28 and had, as I mention above, other sources of institutional support. I didn't much internalize his objectification. I figured he was a sleaze. I suspect this person could and has done more damage to people in more vulnerable positions than I was in at the time. I regret not saying anything for their sake.  ","It did delay completion of my masters degree because I had to seek a new advisor. I continued to work with him for awhile after that particular incident but my distrust for him made it hard to overcome natural hurdles in a mentor/mentee relationship. I went on from that Masters program to enter a PhD program at an elite university. This and other incidents in my past have shaped my attitude toward choosing people to partner with. I won't have anything to do with any professors who give off even a whiff of flirtatious energy. I'm just not interested in dealing with it. This can be quite limiting. Even now I am in a position where someone I find potentially questionable in the way he speaks to female colleagues has been promoted to an administrative position in the Research Center that gave me the fellowship I am presently on. Building a relationship with him could really help me as I look for work beyond my funded years, but, even if he is only a little flirty and dismissive of the accomplishments of the women in his field, I can't play along, I can't disguise my contempt, so I just keep away.

On the recommendation of a mentor, I reached out to some scholars in my field who were in the same city and asked for informational interviews. After one such meeting a coffee shop, one scholar and I split a cab because we were headed in the same direction and it would be expensive separately since it was quite far. When we got in he sat in the middle, directly beside me, even though we were the only two in the back of the taxi. He put his hand on mine, and when I pulled it away, he then put it on my knee. I leaned as far as a possible against the window, and when he asked why I was sitting like that I said my back and neck hurt. He offered to give me a neck massage, which I declined politely. He started to nuzzle my neck with his face  and asked if a kiss would make it feel better. Again I said no thank you and stared determinedly out the window. Thankfully by this point we arrived at his destination. He paid his portion of the ride and got out. The cab took me home and I didn't leave the house for three days.

While my harasser was not a voting member of the department, I later learned that his two closest colleagues (who worked in a suite with him) were the only two 'no' votes on my tenure case and one of them packed the meeting notes with terrible comments on my work and research.  I was ultimately denied tenure.  While I can't prove a connection, I have my suspicions.  When I went back on the market, at one of my job interviews, the chair of the department let me know that my harasser was one of his closest friends in the discipline.  Unsurprisingly, I didn't get that job. ","It was extremely stressful for me.  My chair was supportive and did the right thing, but I struggled at work.  When my harasser was allowed back on campus, he would lurk around my office for hours, making it difficult for me to feel like I could leave my door open or even leave my office.  Even though my chair kept watch over him and helped as much as he could, I never felt safe.  In hindsight, it really aggravates me that I, a professional woman with an excellent research profile and award-winning teaching, had to leave my place of employment.

12/3/2017 11:56:45,"From day one of being hired, I was pursued sexually by my department chair. I was 30, he was 55. He would openly announce his attraction to me in front of students and colleagues. He would openly in front of others express his love for me, describing that he felt about me the same love and attraction as he did for his wife when he first met her. Seeing me, even from afar, would lead to his coming my way to hug me, compliment my looks, my attire, my smile. He would refer to me as his very own Greek goddess. He would call me to meetings in his office to tell me his personal problems and seek my care of him, which when I did not give, made me pursue me all the more fiercely. He declared he needed to be a student in my class to learn from me, and attended every class session for my first semester. He would challenge most everything I said in class. After class, he would stand with his groin in my face as I sat in a deskchair talking with students after class. He would block me from getting out of the chair, so that he could keep his dick close to my mouth. One time as I was bending over to pick up my bag, he ran to the front of the room to put his dick in my face so that when I stood up, my face made contact with his entire crotch. I reported each incident to colleagues and my Dean. I was told to ignore him, as he is mentally ill. I was told he is harmless and that I should laugh it off. I was told that nothing he did was really going to harm my professional development because I was so smart and capable of rising above. When I continued to demand an end to his contact with me, and secured a lawyer, the institution finally put in writing that he is not to be my department chair any  more, that he is to stop attending my class, that he is to have no contact with me, that he is not to address me. All this triggered his fury and his behavior became dangerous. He announced to students that he was divorcing me, and posted a sign on his door that because of my hostility towards him, and University invasiveness, that his liberties are being taken away. Students would laugh and joke about it in front of me. They would tease me to take him back because he was so brokenhearted. They reported he would take up regular class time describing his anger towards me as the divorce proceeded. He made regular derogatory comments about me and anything I contributed as an idea during faculty meetings. He wrote a private letter for my tenure file that was later described to me by members of the t & p committee as pages long, filled with hateful descriptions of my incompetence, and that ""couldn't have been crazier if it had been written in crayon."" Private letters were eliminated from tenure review processes shortly after this episode. The harassment lasted a total of six years, until he was took an early retirement option.

But then he somehow maneuvered me into a corner of this boat, isolated from the rest of the tour group.

12/2/2017 23:07:08,"In mid 2000s, I got invited to the on-campus apartment of a professor with the promise of meeting two huge scientists in my field (all male, of course). Professor was drugged and drunk and proceeded to grope me right in front of the senior scientists that I was trying to talk research with. They more or less ignored me and pretended not to notice the groping. When I extracted myself from that professor (and he fell asleep on the couch), the other scientists decided to leave but insisted I should stay ... which I didn't.
The professor started calling me later that night, insisting I needed to come back because he ""needed me there"". Next day he left roses on my desk with a note ""Sorry"" ... written on the back of a page of my research notes. It took that level of disrespect for my space and research work to notice that the whole thing had been inappropriate all along.

Still, I got pretty close to taking the lowest profile offer on a different continent.
I changed topics in my field to avoid interactions with those scientists - still kept getting invited to conferences and had to keep giving fake excuses for not going. At some point, the harasser even got considered as senior hire at my tenure track institution. Overall, I've spent an inordinate amount of time and energy on avoiding more harassment or confrontations with the past ones.
I still managed quite the career ... but really wonder what I could have done if I'd ever had my brain to myself for a whole week.

12/2/2017 21:37:31,"While in my surgical training, an attending physician broke a valuable instrument. I was called into the department chief who accused me of breaking it. I said I had not. He replied, “Well, you were the only woman there.” I understood I was to take the blame —and ridicule—for the damage. I had to have a second (male) student, of the same or lower rank on the team, present to make sure the replacement instrument was properly used. This, I later learned, was the Dean’s requirement for  purchasing the replacement. For two more years I took on the reluctance of other trainees to team up with my “fumble-fingers.” It even followed me as I pursued post-doc training, as the surgical staff were reluctant to recommend me, based on this false rumor. When I went to the department chair, sweating and vomiting for days before doing so, I literally begged him to recommend me to a very inferior post-doc position. He agreed to do so, with a sense of enormous  magnanimity. I literally kissed him for doing so, I was so relieved. Later I learned he had told the program chief that accepted me that I had been described as someone who could “take one for the team.” The accepting director told me later that this was conveyed in a way that implied I was willing to “do antything” to get ahead. This made the program director think I was being passed over by better programs due to lack of skill, that I was only be promoted due to sexual favors. So when I arrived at my post-doc the reception was guarded until  I could (over)prove my skills. I received what I thought were an unusual amount of sexual suggestions from my post doc faculty until the director finally  told me how I had been presented to him by my former chief. During my humilating 2 years I developed an eating disorder and other self harming behaviors, I think to stop myself from blurting out my story, since to do so would have been the end of my training.

12/2/2017 21:31:37,"When I was in my MFA program, my mentor, who I babysat for regularly, made explicit sexual comments about me both to a close male friend of mine and to an entire class of graduate students that I was not present in. I heard about those comments later from multiple sources - both those who came to me directly and told me about the comments and their graphic nature, and in whispered gossip that traveled through my MFA program like wildfire. ",graduate student,Professor/Mentor,Elite Institution/Ivy League,,English/Creative Writing,,"None. I never reported it. I was 22 years old when it happened, and I was mortified. Until that point, I'd thought of him as a father figure, and I felt completely betrayed. I tried to laugh it off at first, but then I realized how many other students believed the rumors, and so I withdrew from social events and stopped engaging in class. ",None. ,"A number of people in my MFA program were convinced because of the public (and very, very graphic) nature of my mentor's comments that I was sleeping with him, and the gossip spread. It was a particularly bad - and totally false - rumor because he was married at the time (they later divorced, and he subsequently established a pattern of sleeping with very young female graduate students - a new one every year). I was engaged, but my fiancee thankfully trusted me and put no stock in it. I was mortified. It affected my writing for years; for a time, I stopped completely. I felt I had no recourse because it was his word against mine, and he was a very well-known writer. It made me feel completely helpless. I didn't think anyone would believe me. Even now, even given his reputation, there are still people from my MFA program who believe I was having an affair with him, and some who believe that I was the one who broke up his marriage. ","Severe anxiety. Severe damage to my faith in my abilities as a writer - I believed, and still believe, that the compliments he gave about my writing were simply because he wanted to sleep with me. I now have faith in my abilities, but I don't believe for a second that he was doing anything but grooming me. ","I've mostly recovered. I've made a career as a writer and eventually returned to school to earn my PhD, but I am years behind where I would be if he hadn't embarrassed me, undermined me, and messed with my head. The funny thing is, when I reached out to him once when I was still upset and confused and seeking affirmation and an apology, he refused to even respond. It's given me a lot of clarity about the quality of person that he is - which is, of course, completely despicable. ","MFA programs in particular are rife with this kind of misogyny and abuse - I have heard stories from virtually every woman I know who graduated from an MFA program who experienced something like this (plus I'm white, and the stories that I've heard from my friends who are WOC make mine seem tame in comparison). White male writers in particular have egos the size of the Eastern seaboard, and their sense of entitlement to sexual gratification from their female students knows no bounds. Someone needs to do an objective assessment of MFA program dynamics, especially those programs (too many) that are still populated primarily by white male faculty. Those men need to be made to account for their behavior publicly the same way they've dragged the names and reputations of their female graduate students through the mud. And then they need to be put out on their asses and banned from the academy for good.

1) In the first semester of my MA program at a large public R1, I turned a male second year student down for a date and he threatened to ""ruin my career."" He did this to several other women, the grad director knew and did noting because ""he's about to graduate.""
2. During my PhD coursework at a different large public R1, a male professor asked me to come to office hours to discuss my seminar paper. He spent the whole meeting trying to figure out where I lived and if I had a boyfriend; at one point he asked me about my Catholic high school experience and if the uniforms were ""sexy."" I stopped attending the class but turned in the seminar paper. He gave me an A+ in the course. The feedback on my paper was that he hadn't actually read it but would love to discuss it over drinks sometime.

I thought that it would be a dinner with several people, but when I got there, he and I were the only guests. We had dinner, and then afterward, he went into a back room and came back out in his bathrobe. I quickly got up, let him know that this could never happen again and walked out the front door. In retrospect, I feel terrible that I didn't actually report this. It was more than twenty-five years ago, and I know he was doing similar things to other people, but I felt that I handled it on my own. I never received any retribution from him, and I was always a very strong person. But I also understand that many others were more vulnerable than I, and in at least one case, I know that he engaged in retribution toward a student with whom he slept.

At one point a colleague warned me not to ask for letters from him any more, not because he said anything bad, but because the letters he did write for me were so sloppy and incomprehensible. ","Initially, I was s creeped out. I went immediately over to my boyfriend's (now my husband) house after it happened, because I needed to talk about it with someone close to me. In the end, it just made me keep him at arm's length. I was luckily headed to a fellowship that took me to another country, so I did not have any contact with him at all for a year and a half after that, until I came back. By then he was embroiled in the aftermath of the sexual harassment suit I mentioned above. I had little contact with him other than responding to comments from him on my dissertation. ","It did not derail me in any way. But it certainly made me militant about keeping a clear distance between me and my own graduate students. I have a strict code about it, and judge my colleagues pretty harshly if I feel that they have stepped over the line in any way. In one of the institutions where I taught, an assistant professor moved in with an undergraduate student. He had been let go after his third year review, and I did not find out about this relationship until after he had already gone.

He did virtually all of these things, repeatedly, at work (on campus) in the presence of our colleagues. Many of these people literally looked the other way or ignored his behavior. Some articulated wanting to ""stay neutral."" Some of the other men actively encouraged him. I was very very scared, and very much alone. He stole my ipad (full of family photos) and verbally assaulted me in the graduate student office used by all the graduate students in my department. The stalking and harassment went on for months. I was in my second year, studying in the US as a foreign student and he was an American citizen in his fourth year. Finally, the psychological toll (not to mention the toll this all took on my work) of being shunned by my only social network (my colleagues) was so severe, I agreed to reconcile with my ex and we dated for another year before he accepted a post-doc and I was able to get away from him. Yes, the harassment was severe and unacceptable, but it was the total non-support of my colleagues that has stayed with me.

He also enjoyed the lucky break that the bio daughter had a different last name than his--his name is not on her birth certificate.  What was the upshot? it took years for his department (different department than mine) to let him go. What happened to the daughter, her bio-mother, and her extended family was devastating. I am reporting this because it was completely totally buried and had a traumatic impact on many who have had to work with this man. This Ivy is notorious for sexual harassment;  friends and colleagues have identified their rapists on the faculty, but nothing is done. This professor may have faced more serious ramifications--when the Manhattan DA charged him, he agreed to a misdemeanor plea and eventually was removed from the faculty. The willingness of others to believe that he was an innocent or ignore it is appalling. I am reporting this because this level of sexual impropriety/harassment/assault (whatever you would choose to call it) happens in large part because others are ultimately complicit.

12/2/2017 12:51:11,"Jan 20, 2008 I was in a shared graduate student office late at night, I asked a fellow grad student if he would be staying late and, if so, if he could walk me to my bike otherwise I would leave early. He said he was planning to stay late and agreed to walk me to my bike. These are my notes from the incident: 

I finished reading a little after 10pm and as I started packing up * sparked up a conversation about his loneliness and his relationship status. He confessed that he was reading a self-help book about relationships because he felt really lonely and couldn’t figure out how to meet someone. He mentioned that in the book he was reading the author said that women immediately knew whether or not they would sleep with a man upon meeting him. He then proceeded to ask me about my relationships. He asked me if I had ever had a one night stand and I said no. He said he couldn’t believe it and said that he had slept with a lot of virgins—that these young women would pick him out, in a club, for example, and ask to sleep with him. I told him I found it odd and unbelievable. I can’t recall the exact details of the conversation at this point, but I do know that as he continued to ask me about my relationships and the role that sex played in my relationships.

At one point * suddenly asked me “Do you want to fuck?” 
I said “No, I would never sleep with you.” 
He said “Well, when I look at you I want to fuck you. When you look at me do you want to fuck me?”
I repeated myself, “No, I would never sleep with you.”
He acted shocked. 
He told me something along the lines of “I can fuck for hours.” 
He also told me that his room was nearby. 
I told him “You’re being really creepy ***,” because by this point the entire tone of the conversation had changed dramatically, and I was startled and afraid.  Although he denied that he was acting creepy, I repeated myself. I called his behavior creepy at least 4 times and he asked me to stop saying it. He said something like “That’s the kind of thing you say about criminals” (he might have said “…about a molester” I can’t remember exactly). He was visibly upset by my comment.

As I was sitting down printing, *** positioned himself standing behind me and asked me “What kind of panties are you wearing?” 
I told him to stop, and that he was really creeping me out. 

I was really afraid that I was alone with him and I would have to walk outside to get my bike and that he might hurt me. In an effort to direct the conversation, once again, toward his inappropriate behavior, I started a conversation about how he related to woman in the history department. I told him that I thought he had problems communicating with women and that other women in the department had mentioned as much. I told him that a couple of women had complained to me that he didn’t acknowledge them or say hello, and that in this instance, when he was actually talking to one of his female colleagues, his behavior had become inappropriate very quickly. He got defensive again and told me that he always tried to be very objective and that he wanted people to think of him as such, and that perhaps he was misunderstood. I told him that, on the contrary, he wasn’t objective at all; that he was one of the most dogmatic people I knew and that other people in the department might agree with me. At this point we were walking outside and I had already picked up my bike. He told me that the reason he didn’t acknowledge women or even say hello to them was because his aunt had told him that, as a man, any little thing you do—even looking at a woman the wrong way—might be misinterpreted as sexual harassment. 

I discovered that another female graduate student had also been sexually harassed by *** who had been assigned as her mentor in the department. We met with our mutual adviser and with the head of the department to report our experiences. ",graduate student,graduate student,Other R1,University of Arizona,history,,The head of the history department said the university had invested so much in him that they would not jeopardize his career based on what would appear to university lawyers as hearsay at best and defamation of character at worst.

My adviser fought to include in his file something about the fact that he had been accused of sexual harassment by two female graduate students. (It turned out that an undergraduate student had also complained about him but due to privacy issues no one shared the details.),"None that I can see, according to his online profile he's currently an Assistant Professor of History at the American University in Dubai ","I don't know, it took me a long time finish my MA, which might have been a function of many things that had nothing to do with the harasser. One striking aspect of the whole thing is that when he and I took historiography together, the male professor of the course I asked me to take it easy on him because I routinely challenged his interpretation of the readings. I developed an understanding that he was in a profession invested in protecting him and his career. I did go on to complete my PhD a different institution and currently have a post-doc.

12/2/2017 12:41:41,"A male student in my grad program regularly sexualized the rest of our cohort, referring regularly to the other male students as his ""competition"" and making sexualized comments about women. In this context, he became irate at me for disagreeing with him during a group project, and literally stopped speaking to me, despite the fact that we had the project to finish. When I talked to him about it, he became physically threatening with me, and I became genuinely worried that he knew where I lived. Shortly thereafter, he made unwanted sexual advances and kissed another student without her consent. Afterwards, while still in the classroom after class, he exploded at her, stood threateningly over her, called her a fucking bitch and left the classroom in a rage. He went to rant about the two of us in vulgar and explicit terms in front of many of our classmates on campus. This was the point at which I filed the formal complaint. I later learned he had also harassed at least four other students (which amounted to almost half of the women in our program). After four of us reported him, he continued to behave threateningly, to the point that when I talked to my female advisor about him, she said that the faculty was concerned too, but they didn't know how to handle it because they feared that if they upset him, they could have a ""Virginia Tech"" situation on their hands. She literally was scared that he would carry out a mass shooting if the faculty stood up for us.",MA Student,Another MA student in my cohort,Other Type of School,,Education,,"Four women (including myself) in my cohort reported the same male student for sexual/gender based harassment. We each met with the head of student affairs. He did not initiate a hearing, even though we asked for one directly. No consequences of any kind befell the harasser. Two of us who reported him asked for the accommodation of not being placed in small groups in our shared mandatory class with him. The (female) professor of this class refused to comply and repeatedly grouped us together. The other two women chose not to tell that they had also filed complaint when they saw how badly we were treated. The dean got involved, and while he was sympathetic to what we were going to, and intervened on our behalf with the professor, she continued to defy direct orders from the dean and place us in groups with him. This professor publicly took the side of the male student and told others in our program that we were ""bullying"" him by reporting the harassment. At one point, I had to call step out of class and call him (the dean) about what was happening in the session. After this, I filed for a no contact order (the student equivalent of a restraining order). ","As far as I know, none.","The professor who sided with the harasser is reasonably prominent in one of the professional organizations in our field (luckily, not the most prominent, but still relatively major), and whenever I see her at conferences, she shoots death glares at me. This had led to me avoiding collaboration with this organization. I was also for a time very concerned that this would impact my ability to get letters of recommendation, since this situation created a very toxic environment for my entire cohort, which lasted all year and spread throughout the entire program. Luckily, two of the faculty members became quiet allies, who supported us, but didn't intervene on our behalf with their colleagues (at least not in an impactful way). So I got what I needed from the program (a degree and strong recommendations) and am in good shape careerwise.","This was really traumatic. In many ways, trying to get the administration and faculty to behave appropriately was more traumatic than the actual harassment itself. Sometimes I wonder if I should have not said anything, but when I think about the fact that he was clearly moving through the whole program finding new targets, I really couldn't have in good conscience not said anything. I spent a lot of time crying in the campus counsellor's office because of it though.","If anything, this has made me more determined to succeed. I sometimes use the pure injustice of the situation and how it was handled to motivate me to be the absolute best, because this shit is not going to stop me.

He was also married, had children, and was serving as a graduate representative for our program.

The second incident was a graduate student who in the cohort that came in two years later, we had known each other in undergrad as well, he was just embarking on coursework.",Other R1,Stony Brook University,Comparative Literature and Cultural Studies,,"I never reported it, having heard stories from other women in the department about the stress of reporting to the graduate school, the burden of proof placed on the victim, and the refusal by the institution to deal with the situation.","None (but to be fair, I never reported the incident).",None so far other than some feelings of no longer feeling comfortable in my workplace.,"It definitely increased my stress. For a while I was angry, I hated that graduate candidate. I was surprised to find that those closest to me in my personal life (my family and significant other) were quick to blame me. ""What were you doing in a bar with this guy?"" Well, obviously I was at a graduate student happy hour, but unfortunately circumstances that evening left an opening when one student (who later said he had made her uncomfortable as well) suddenly rushed out of the event, the other remaining graduate student went to check on her, and this left a window of time where my colleague and I were left alone at the table. I think of the people in my support network I told, only two immediately said what had happened to me was wrong, and that this male graduate student had taken advantage of the situation. Everyone else either blamed me, or said ""well, he's under a lot of pressure, it's probably just an isolated incident, you should just forgive him."" It hurt to feel the lack of support, and probably the biggest thing this student's actions revealed to me were the limitations of my own relationships, THAT was the hardest, for example, to hear my mom say ""what were you doing alone in a bar with this graduate student?"" I think she realized later that she was victim blaming but, I'll never forget that she never really apologized to me for victim blaming. At least my boyfriend at the time apologized for his initial victim blaming response, but you want your parents to understand. Ultimately, I think I recovered quickly 1. because the incident stopped at verbal harassment and 2. as an underrepresented minority you get used to blocking out the demeaning or upsetting things people say and use that discrimination to fuel your drive rather than letting it become a distraction. I made up my mind after that incident that, since he would likely not be impacted at all, I wasn't going to let him impact my career trajectory, and I wanted to take the time I would spend seeking institutional support, and instead funnel it into my research. I am privileged to be in a field where I did not need to interact with this guy regularly because the humanities aren't as collaborative as some other fields. Nevertheless, I'll probably never enter another department with the level of trust and belief in my colleagues that I came to this institution with, probably a good thing because as the news seems to be proving this is the reality we live in, and sexual harassment is a large part of it. It definitely saddens me to feel the burden of always being suspicious and self-protecting, but I feel like it's up to me to guard my mental health because large institutions like Universities are looking at liability management not the good of its population.","It didn't change much. Like I said, in the humanities our work is done in a more isolated environment, and luckily this graduate student wanted to graduate and leave academia, so I likely won't encounter him again. If anything, it probably increased my empathy towards others to have experienced how powerless one feels in the face of workplace sexual harassment. The harassment made me more determined to succeed in my career because I don't think it was really about sexual desire, I think this graduate student felt threatened by his female colleagues and was acting out (because a number of female graduate students and candidates, and even female students who had graduated with their Ph.D. shared stories with me or friends who told them my story about this guy making them uncomfortable, making unwanted physical contact, stuff like that) and I want to show, you can't frighten off your competitors that way, so I'll keep going, and hopefully one day I'll be in a position to advocate for change in how sexual harassment at the University is handled. The sad part is probably, all of us have given this guy the benefit of the doubt only to discover later just how many of us there were.

After chatting with other hotel guests in the lobby one night (because, yes, it is quite common to meet other conference goers at your same accommodation place), this old white male professor starting chatting with me and hen proceeding to hit on me and try to diss out if he could go further. I immediately shut him down because I was uncomfortable. In the years since I only told one female friend immediately after and one other person since (besides therapists, etc).

My value as a female body was more than the value of my intellectual contributions. 

The following year, this man apologized to me. I told him that it was not okay but let’s move forward. Then, in the same breath he was suggestive again.

He told me inappropriate things about his childhood and tried to insert topics like incest into our conversations, perhaps because he had read my sexual abuse into my poetry or because he knew I was pursuing a Title IX case. He would constantly try to bring up my father or compare himself to my father (i.e. ""I know I'm not your dad, but I'm really proud of you""). He would constantly compare me to his girlfriend, later wife, and set up a meeting between us for unknown reasons. He seemed thrilled that it had gone well. He would ask me deeply personal questions about my case and my life and I would leave these meetings feeling as though I had something taken from me. He would send emails filled with winky and smiley faces. I felt unsettled by his behavior, but it wasn't until I started talking to others in the department that I learned I wasn't alone. One fellow student told me that she had quit the department because of him and that he ""loved little girls"" like me. I also found out that he had been sleeping with one of his master's students and dumped her as she was graduating. This relationship was initiated after he invited the student to go out for wine. Later, the professor shared with me the unofficial guide to grad school that he gave all hopeful MFAs. One of the pieces of advice was that ""some professors may prefer to meet over wine."" Also in the guide was a recommendation that students attend a popular writing conference so that they could ""have consensual sex with other writers ;)."" Almost every female student I knew that had taken his classes seemed to fall into his web, talking about him constantly and despairing if he criticized their work. One of these students sent the professor a very sexual poem that was explicitly about him, and instead of taking appropriate actions he sent her back an email asking not to write about him because he ""had to be careful about these things"" because he'd ""run into trouble before."" This professor is very well-connected in his field and seems to know everyone, especially since he runs a printing press.  ",Undergraduate student,"Professor, thesis advisor ",Other R1,University of Arizona,Creative Writing/English ,,"I am sure that the institution knows about the professor's behavior, considering his comments about needing to be careful and to leave his door open.

I feel he has deprived me of access to resources (such as networking) and support that I could have if I did not have these anxieties. He made me doubt my own talents and abilities--are all male professors complimenting me only because they want to sleep with me? This experience along with other institutional betrayals has all but taken away my sense of trust in institutional proceedings, such that I would likely not choose to ever go through them if something else were to happen to me. I lost relationships with other professors in the department and other students who are still in his web because I can't stand to see them enable him and sing his praises as if it's not known that he's a creep and not at all the ""ally"" he would like us to think he is. ","I felt crazy for assuming that he was targeting me because he knows how to do so in a very subtle way (perhaps he's learned that sleeping with his students outright is the fast track to trouble?) His behavior made me feel even more isolated and lonely in a time when I was already struggling. I am angry as hell about his abuses of power and exploitation of those he knows or assumes have already been victimized. I talk about these incidents frequently in therapy and feel stuck--what can I do? how can I fix the situation? who else is he hurting now? I feel an immense burden. I have nightmares in which I try to remedy his behavior, to get back at him, to make him accountable. ","I no longer write poetry or have much interest in the field.

Ranking other departmental members by their looks and intelligence, in addition to ranking students in similar ways. Good looks = intelligence. Some of my students were better looking than me, according to him, and therefore more intelligent than me as well. It's a real ego boost to know that your colleague thinks that your 19 year old students out shine you in the realm of intellectual achievements. 

 One day we were walking down a hallway in a classroom building and a young female student walked by. He turned his head, looked her up and down, and said - Damn, why do they have to be so cute? Couldn't they tone it down to make life easier for us?  

Spoke regularly of the influence he had on my eventual tenure application. ",1st Year Tenure Track Assistant Professor,"Tenured Professor, Senior Professor in Subject Area within department, Designated Departmental ""Mentor""",Other Type of School,,Psychology ,,"After I had been in the department for many months, someone else in the department came to 'check in on me' to let me know that it was generally known that my harasser was a harasser and they wanted to make sure I was okay. They didn't want to make sure he was reported, or that anything was done to stop it, they just wanted me to know they knew that he was an issue and that he had been an issue in the past as well. ?!?!?!? Taking the perspective of an objective outsider, this is horrific. It is institutional support, knowledge and protection of someone who is a serial offender. As the person experiencing the harassment and trying to make sense of it, I actually felt better after the person spoke with me and I learned that ""I wasn't the only one."" At least this let me know that 'it wasn't in my head' and it also made me feel somewhat 'off the hook' about whether or not I had a responsibility to report the behaviour. My main concern before had been whether this person was treating other people this way as well or potentially treating the students in the same way. I was worried that somehow I was the only one with this information and that if I didn't tell anyone I would be complicit in whatever other 'bad deeds' he was committing on campus. It sounds ridiculous to actually type this out, but knowing that the department and the administration already knew that this person was a predator took the weight off of me, and therefore made me feel better. It also made me angry. Why did they leave me be for so many months? Why wasn't I warned immediately? And really, why is this person employed at the university? This last question though, seems almost silly. We all know the reasons why. Instead of making a fuss or trying to prove a case, they just sit back and hope that he will retire. The women in the department take on additional students in order to avoid the potential situation of having a known predator serve as a student's primary supervisor. The women in the department teach overloads, have classes filled past the cap because one of the senior, tenured professors is a known predator and therefore cannot be trusted with upper level courses. Honestly, if you cannot trust someone with a room of 20 young girls, why can you trust them with a room of 90 young girls? ","None. He is biding his time, pulling in a full professor salary at the top of the grid waiting until it is absolutely necessary to retire. He doesn't have to do research, he doesn't have to supervise students (because they're worried about how he'll interact with them if he does), he doesn't have to teach new courses. He has a great job. ","Too soon to tell. I haven't quit yet. I tend to not go to my office very much. I work mostly from home whenever possible. I began doing this so as to avoid his visits to my office. Eventually, it seemed to work. When I do go to my office now, he doesn't seem to come knocking. However, I continue to go rather irregularly, so for all I know, he does still come knocking and I am just not there to answer. In the long run, this could have a negative impact on my career if it has created the impression that I am not around. I know that they tell tenure track people to ""look busy"" and to ""be seen."" I've basically done the opposite in an attempt to avoid him as much as possible. Luckily, I think that my track record on paper will make up for this, as there's very little else to find fault with me on other than the amount of time I spend in my office vs. working from other locations. ","Starting a new tenure track position is known to be stressful, but honestly, it was this harassment that made the beginning of my position as a professor the most stressful and the most upsetting. I wrote 3 grants in my first year, taught an overload, and published 5 manuscripts. I did not find any of that stressful - I enjoyed my work. What kept me up at nights, what brought me to tears, and what made me hide from my office was the stress and discomfort of wondering what to do about the sexual harassment I was experiencing. Teaching 3 new courses, teaching for the first time ever, writing grants, continuing my research - none of that brought me to tears in my first year. The only thing that brought me to tears was my experiences with this one individual - who was supposedly doing all that he could to 'help' me. ",The experience really burst my bubble. I honestly believed that the trope of the 'old creepy male professor' was a thing of the past. I never in my life expected that I would come face to face with the cold reality that this still takes place. It has tarnished what should have been the most exciting part of my career up to this point. ,"Good idea. the Chronicle of HE seems to be collecting similar info, but you have better questions  - so I filled yours out but not theirs.

12/1/2017 15:49:12,"At the beginning of my Ph.D. program, I would stop by the office of a professor whose work I admired. It was my second semester in the program and I was enrolled in his course. As we were talking, he asked me who I was TA-ing for. I told him and he then asked if ""the freshmen boys thought she was attractive?"" I felt blindsided by this question and uncomfortable. I responded with ""Why would I know that?"" I found it creepy, but shook it off as an older man trying to be funny. On another occasion, he lamented to me how the undergraduates now were all too busy on their phones between class instead of ""going back to their dorm rooms to get to know each other better."" He would always pepper our conversations with comments like these which made interacting with him uncomfortable. I was hoping to get some kind of guidance and mentorship as I went through the program since he is recognized name in the field. I never felt like I was taken seriously because of his inappropriate comments. Another time, I was dressed up to give a lecture in a tasteful outfit which included a knee-length pencil skirt and knee-high boots--holdovers from a previous job in an non-profit office setting. He came up to me in a hallway and stood much too close to tell me how ""sexy"" he thought my outfit was and how I should dress like that more often. That was the last time I ever wore a skirt. The rest of the time in the program, I dressed androgynously in jeans and over-sized t-shirts. I also stopped going by his office. Whatever contacts or advice he could have given me was not worth having to listen to his creepy comments about his loneliness or how he'd love to have his female students to his apartment, but ""the bed is much too small."" I felt that he was testing the waters to see if he could get away with more than just saying something questionable. I decided I never wanted to be alone with him, ever. Comparing notes with other females students, I found out he did it to almost every women he encountered, but since he was a decades-long member of the faculty, nothing was ever done about his behavior.He may have received a slap on the wrist about 15 years ago, but that's about all.
